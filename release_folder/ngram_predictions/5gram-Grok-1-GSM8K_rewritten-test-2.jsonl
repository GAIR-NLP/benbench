Typically, she goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. On a particular day, she was found sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. Additionally, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than her usual time to use the bathroom. How many minutes did Kim spend sleeping in her bed that day?  Out of the 24 hours in a day, 10 p.m. translates to 22 hours. Therefore, until 12 a.m. or 24 hours, Kim slept for 24 - 22 = 2 hours. In total, Kim typically sleeps for 2 + 6 = 8 hours a day, which is equivalent to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. Kim's sleepwalking lasted for 38 - 15 = 23 minutes. Including the 5 minutes she was awake before her usual wake-up time, Kim was either sleepwalking or awake for a total of 23 + 5 = 28 minutes within her regular sleep routine. Consequently, on that specific day, Kim spent 480 - 28 = 452 minutes sleeping in her bed.\n#### 452",

Next, calculate the width of each fabric piece by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet. Then, find the area of each fabric piece by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet.

To determine the average heel height, calculate the total inches from the 4-inch heels worn by three women: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches. Next, find the total inches from the 2-inch heels worn by three women: 3 women * 2 inches/woman = <<3*2=6>>6 inches. Add the total inches from both types of heels to get the overall total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches. Since there are 3 women with 4-inch heels and 3 women with 2-inch heels, there are 3 + 3 = <<3+3=6>>6 women in total. Divide the total inches by the number of women to find the average heel height per woman: 18 inches / 6 women = <<18/6=3>>3 inches per woman.\n#### 3",

If the company's initial workforce consists of 200 employees, and each employee receives a monthly salary of $4000, what is the total salary expenditure by the company on its employees over three months?  With an addition of 20 new employees each month, the total number of employees in the company after the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees. The total salary paid to the employees in the first month amounts to 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000. Following this, as 20 more employees are hired in the second month, the total workforce increases to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees. Consequently, the company's salary expenses in the second month reach 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000. Upon hiring an additional 20 employees in the third month, the total staff count rises to 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees. The company disburses $1040000 on salaries in the third month. Therefore, the total salary expenditure over the three months sums up to $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000.\n#### 2880000",

What was Watson's total earnings in April if the company performed exceptionally well throughout the month?  Watson earns $10 per day, making his daily earnings 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100. With a five-day workweek, he works for a total of 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 days in a month. Therefore, his total earnings for the month amount to 20 * 100 = $<<20*100=2000>>2000. In addition to his regular pay, he receives a bonus of 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 for the outstanding performance of the company in April. Consequently, by the end of April, Watson's total earnings sum up to 2000 + 1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.\n#### 3200",

Given that his degree tripled his income from a $25,000 per year job, how long will it take for him to recoup the money lost from not working during school and repay the loans?  With his income rising to $25,000 x 3 = $<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 annually, Jim gains an extra $75,000 - $25,000 = $<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 per year. The total loan amount is $50,000 x 4 = $<<50000*4=200000>>200,000, and the income loss from not working during college is $25,000 x 4 = $<<25000*4=100000>>100,000. To cover both the loans and the lost income, Jim needs to earn $200,000 + $100,000 = $<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000.

To determine the number of red chickens, set up the equation 3r + 5w = 42, where r represents the red chickens and w represents the white chickens. Given that w = r + 2, substitute r + 2 for w in the equation to get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. After simplification, 8r + 10 = 42.

Initially, dividing the number of elves by 3 reveals that 20 elves quit due to vomiting: 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves. By subtracting this number from the initial count of elves, we find the remaining elves: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves. Subtracting the elves who quit after being kicked provides the final number remaining: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.\n#### 30",

Venue one requires an additional $5 per guest for food, whereas venue two includes food in its price. How many guests need to attend for the costs of the two venues to be the same?  The total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5*X, where X represents the number of guests. Similarly, the cost for the second venue is 25*X. To find the point where these costs are equivalent, we set up the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.

Currently, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool. How much water does the smaller pool contain at present?  The total amount of water lost from the pools in 4 minutes is calculated as 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons. Let b represent the current water quantity in the larger pool and s be the amount in the smaller pool. Given b = 4s and b + 16 = 2(s + 16), substituting the first equation into the second yields 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16). Simplifying this equation results in 4s + 16 = 2s + 32. By subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32. Further, subtracting 16 from both sides gives 2s = 16. Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find s = <<8=8>>8.\n#### 8",

After applying the 50% discount, each T-shirt costs $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4. Thus, the total cost for both T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12.

To determine the total stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed, add 2 pounds and 8 pounds: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds. Then, calculate the average stuffing amount by dividing the total stuffing by 2: 10 pounds / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds.

Profit is the variance between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Kim generate every week?  Kim tallies a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients. Per week, he will need 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach. He will also require 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths weekly. The 16 bottles of bleach will amount to 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32. The 8 packs of cloths will sum up to 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40. Consequently, Kim's weekly total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.

The brokerage fee amounts to $350,000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17,500. The transfer fee is $350,000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42,000.

Despite the city council's refusal to repair it, Ron faces a $120 fine for unauthorized road maintenance if he decides to fix it himself. Additionally, he needs to purchase 3 buckets of asphalt, each priced at $25. How much money will Ron save by personally fixing the pothole?  Begin by calculating the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75. Next, deduct the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the total cost of the damage Ron would avoid: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255.\n#### 255",

To determine the calories in a mini cinnamon roll, divide 600 calories by 3: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories.

Then, multiply this by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = <<150*300=45000>>45000 calories.

The first group of workers each made 6 toys per hour * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys during their shift, totaling 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys. The second group made 4 toys per hour * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys each, totaling 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys. Together, the two groups made 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys. If the order still lacks 20 toys, the total produced by all workers is 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys. This implies that the fifth worker contributed 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys. Hence, the fifth worker's production rate is 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.\n#### 18",

Initially, the temperature increases due to the oven by 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees. Adding this to the initial temperature of 40 degrees gives a total of 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees. The window is open for 30 minutes, which translates to 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3 intervals of 2-degree temperature decreases. Therefore, the total decrease is 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.

Due to a lack of change, Artie decides to round all prices to the nearest dollar. If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he earn?  Artie will adjust the price of marigolds up from $2.74 to $3 because the number after the 2 is 5 or higher. The price of petunias will be rounded up from $1.87 to $2 since the number after the 1 is 5 or higher. The price of begonias will be rounded down from $2.12 to $2 since the number after the 2 is less than 5. Artie will earn $36 from selling 12 marigolds, $18 from selling 9 petunias, and $34 from selling 17 begonias, totaling $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.\n#### 88",

Even if the regular teacher returns, there is a 40% chance she will grant an extension to the class. In the event that the class doesn't receive an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can persuade the teacher that his dog destroyed his work and get a personal extension. What is the probability that Marcus will need to submit his homework tomorrow?  Let's start by calculating the probability of the regular teacher showing up by deducting the chance she won't: 100% - 50% = 50%. Then, determine the likelihood of the teacher not granting an extension by subtracting the chance she does: 100% - 40% = 60%. Next, find the probability that Marcus won't receive a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does: 100% - 20% = 80%. Now, calculate the probability of the teacher showing up and not giving an extension to the class by multiplying the two independent probabilities: 0.6 * 0.5 = <<0.6*0.5=0.3>>0.3. Multiply this probability by the chance Marcus can't get a personal extension to determine the probability he must turn in his homework: 0.3 * 0.8 = <<0.3*0.8=0.24>>0.24. Finally, convert the decimal probability into a percentage: 0.24 * 100% = <<0.24*100=24>>24%.\n#### 24",

Consequently, the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital, initially 1000 beds, can be calculated as 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds. As 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week amounts to 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients. Over two weeks, the cumulative number of patients admitted reaches 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, each requiring a bed.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, what is the total weight of a container holding one of each animal if the container itself weighs 20 pounds?  If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and is equivalent in weight to the blue beetle and green toad, then the total weight of these three animals is 3*50 = 150 pounds. The yellow snake, weighing 10 pounds more than the pink frog, would weigh 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds. Therefore, the combined weight of the frog, beetle, toad, and snake would be 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds. Given that the pink frog is 20 pounds heavier than the red bird, the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds. Consequently, the total weight of all the animals would be 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds.

Finally, add the length of the other baked goods in feet to find the overall length: 120 feet + 160 feet = <<120+160=280>>280 feet.\n#### 280",

Each large sticker can be exchanged for a large button or three small buttons, while a small sticker is equivalent to one small button. Additionally, a large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine initially possesses 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She decides to trade 90% of her small stickers for large buttons and 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, with the remaining large stickers exchanged for small buttons. How many buttons does she accumulate in total by the end?  She exchanges 27 small stickers because 30 x 0.9 = <<27=27>>27. Subsequently, she receives 9 large buttons for these since 27 divided by 3 equals <<27/3=9>>9. She swaps 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x 0.5 = 20, obtaining 20 large buttons in return since 20 divided by 1 equals <<20/1=20>>20. By trading 50% of her large stickers for small buttons, which corresponds to 20 large stickers, she acquires 60 small buttons as 20 multiplied by 3 equals <<20*3=60>>60. In conclusion, she possesses a total of 89 buttons because 9 + 20 + 60 equals <<9+20+60=89>>89.\n#### 89",

First, determine the number of correctly answered multiple-choice questions: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions. Then, ascertain the number of correctly answered true/false questions: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions. The sum of the correct responses to both question types is the total number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions, which also translates to the points she scored since each question is worth 1 point. Next, find the number of correctly answered 5-point questions: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions. Multiply this by the points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points.

With the aim of conserving chalk, he limits his daily use to 20% and recycles any piece smaller than 2 inches. On Monday, the teacher surpassed his usual chalk usage and consumed 45% of it. If he reverts to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have left before he needs to recycle this piece?  The teacher utilized 45% of his 5-inch chalk stick on Monday, equal to 5 * 0.45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches. After this usage, he had 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches remaining. The following day, he will consume 20% of the 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * 0.2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>0.55 inches. This leaves him with 2.75 - 0.55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk. On the subsequent day, he will use 2.2 * 0.2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>0.44 inches of chalk, resulting in 2.2 - 0.44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches left.

The first train is expected in 10 minutes and will be there for 20 minutes. The second train arrives half an hour after the first one leaves and stays for a quarter of the time the first train does. The third train arrives an hour after the second one leaves and departs immediately upon arrival. The fourth train, which is the one Paul needs, arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. How many minutes, in total, will Paul have to wait for his train?  The first train's duration is 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes. Thus, Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes. The second train comes after half an hour, which is 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes. It remains for a quarter of the time the first train does, which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes. Therefore, Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes. The third train comes an hour later, which is 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.

Each banana is priced at 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1, making the total cost of bananas in the crate 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5. Since an orange is three times as expensive as a banana, it is priced at 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3. Therefore, the cost of the oranges in the crate is 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.

If Kelly's budget is $65, how much money does she have remaining in her budget?  Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.

The strawberries cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12. Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves, each equipped with steel pickaxes, mine in a month consisting of 30 days?  To determine the ore mined by a dwarf with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day. Then, by increasing this by 150%, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day. Consequently, the total ore mined by 40 dwarves equipped with steel pickaxes is: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day. Finally, multiplying the daily yield by the days in a month gives the total ore mined: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds/day.\n#### 43200",

After reviewing the instructions, she calculated that it would require 20 minutes to prepare the cake batter, 30 minutes to bake the cake, 2 hours to cool, and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake. If Jordan aims to make the cake on the same day and have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm, what is the latest time she can start making the cake?  As 1 hour equals 60 minutes, Jordan needs 2 hours to cool the cake, which equals 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Combining the time needed for making the batter (20 min), baking (30 min), cooling (120 min), and frosting (10 min), the total time required is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes. Converting 180 minutes to hours results in 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours. Since the cake must be ready by 5:00 pm and it takes 3 hours to make, Jordan should start no later than 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm.\n#### 2",

Out of 500 third-graders, 340 passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders also passed. The pass rate for the fifth graders was double the pass rate for the fourth graders. What is the overall pass rate for the school?  Begin by determining the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>0.4. Double this to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: 0.4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>0.8. Next, multiply the pass rate for fifth graders by the total number of fifth graders to find the number of passing fifth graders: 0.8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders. Then, sum up the passing students from each grade to get the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students. Add up the total students in each grade to determine the overall number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students. Lastly, divide the number of passing students by the total students, and then multiply by 100% to get the total pass rate: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%.\n#### 70",

The blue rope's length is Y - 7, and the red rope's length is 4 times (Y - 7). Setting up the equation Y + Y - 7 + 4(Y - 7) = 37 cm, we solve for Y to find Y = 12 cm.

Job B offers a fixed annual salary of $42,000 but is in a state that imposes $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax on net income post-property tax. How much more money will Nick earn at the job with the higher net pay rate when compared to the other job?  To begin with, calculate the total yearly salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000. Then, determine Nick's tax payment for Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: 0.2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000. Subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to get his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000. Afterwards, deduct Nick's property taxes from his total income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000. Proceed by calculating Nick's income tax at Job B by multiplying his income after property tax by 10%: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600. Next, subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400. Lastly, determine the difference between the net income of the lower-paying job (A) and the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400.\n#### 8400",

With April having 30 days, split evenly into 15 days for each half, he saves (15*(y/2)) in the first half and (15*y) in the second half, totaling $1125.

However, he realizes that he baked 15 more cookies than planned. Unfortunately, 5 cookies accidentally fall as he is placing them to cool, leaving him with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?  By adding the cookies he dropped, Henry baked a total of 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year. Since he inadvertently made more, he must have intended to bake 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double the amount from last year. Therefore, he must have baked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50",

Initially, he benefitted from a promotional offer of $8 per month for the first 6 months, which later increased to the regular rate of $12 per month. Subsequently, after 8 months at the regular rate, the service raised its price to $14 per month. What is the total cost for 2 years of the service for Bill?  There are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years. Out of these 24 months, Bill pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months. For the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, he pays 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48. For the regular rate of $12 a month for 8 months, he pays 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96. Lastly, for the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, he pays 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140. Therefore, over two years, his total cost amounts to $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.\n#### 284",

How much longer does it take to ride the longest slide than the second longest slide?

Given that a total of 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are placed in each cage?  Among the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw. Combining the straw for the hamsters and rabbits gives 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw. Consequently, the rats have 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straw remaining. Thus, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw per cage.

Upon reaching the checkout, she was informed that there was a 20% discount on everything. How much did she have to pay in total?  The 5 utensils at $5.00 each amount to 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00. Combining this with the $120 pots and pans and the $20 mixing bowls, the total before the discount is 25+120+20 = $<<25+120+20=165>>165. With a 20% discount, the discount is 165 * 0.20 = $<<165*0.20=33.00>>33.00. As her initial total was $165, after deducting the $33.00 discount, her final payment is 165 - 33 = $<<165-33=132.00>>132.00.\n#### 132",

Then, half of the yellow balloons were accidentally released. Later, she found and added 75% of 8 blue balloons to the remaining ones. How many balloons did she ultimately bring into the school?  Initially, Sally had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, totaling 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons. After 40% of the red balloons burst, she was left with 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons. Then, releasing half of the yellow balloons left her with (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons. Adding 75% of the 8 blue balloons found, she included 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons. Consequently, starting with 44 balloons, losing 10 red, 6 yellow, and adding 6 blue balloons resulted in 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons.\n#### 34",

What proportion of the watermelon does each adult receive?  Let x represent the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives. Given that each kid's portion is half of each adult's share, every child receives x/2 percent of the watermelon. Therefore, the watermelon is divided into parts representing 2*x for adults and 4*(x/2) for kids by percentage. Since the total has to be 100%, the equation simplifies to 2x + 2x = 100. Solving for x gives x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, indicating that each adult receives 25% of the watermelon.\n#### 25",

Antonella is eligible for a 30% commission on the initial $1000 of goods, which amounts to 30/100 * $1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300. For the additional $1500 of goods beyond $1000, she earns a 10% commission, totaling $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150. Therefore, Antonella's total earnings include $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission, summing up to $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450.\n#### 450",

Additionally, 15% of the sales were BMX bikes, which amounts to 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes. The remaining sales were MTB bikes, totaling 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes.

Additionally, for the other 6 toys, priced at $7 each, the total would be 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42. Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the buyer's terms, his earnings would be 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.\n#### 72",

Since three other bidders each raised the desk's price by $50, a total of 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 was added to the desk's cost by others.

Simultaneously, Ms. B added 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons to the tank. Together, they pumped a total of 3375 gallons + 4500 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day. On the second day, Wanda contributed 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons, while Ms. B only added 3375 gallons * 1/3 = 1125 gallons. Collectively, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on the second day. Over the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = 12000 gallons.

If all the babies in blue outfits and 1/3 of those in purple outfits also wear bows, what is the probability percentage that a bow-wearing baby is dressed in purple?  First, determine the number of babies in purple outfits: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies. Then, calculate the number of babies in purple outfits wearing bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies. Next, subtract the number of purple-dressed babies from the total number of babies to get the count of blue-dressed babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies. Lastly, divide the number of purple bow-wearing babies by the total number of bow-wearing babies to get the probability percentage that a bow-wearing baby is in purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%.\n#### 50",

In a single skein of yarn, there are 364 yards. What is the total yardage of yarn they used together?  Mariah's grandma utilized 1/2 of a skein of yarn. By multiplying this by (2/2) to achieve a common denominator, we get 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4. Now, with common denominators, combining Mariah's 1/4 skein of yarn and her grandma's 2/4 skein of yarn results in 3/4 of a skein of yarn. 3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = 273 yards.\n#### 273",

Firstly, calculate the percentage of pizzas remaining from the glee club's order: 100% - 70% = 30%. Then, multiply this percentage by the initial number of pizzas ordered by the glee club to determine the remaining pizzas: 30% * 20 pizzas = <<30*.01*20=6>>6 pizzas. Next, determine the number of pizzas the football team ordered by doubling the glee club's order: 20 pizzas * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas. Subsequently, find the percentage of pizzas left from the football team's order: 100% - 80% = 20%. Multiply this percentage by the number of pizzas ordered by the football team to find the remaining pizzas: 20% * 40 pizzas = <<20*.01*40=8>>8 pizzas. Lastly, add the remaining pizzas from both groups to find the total number of pizzas left: 8 pizzas + 6 pizzas = <<8+6=14>>14 pizzas.\n#### 14",

Given that Carly's class consists of five individuals, each receiving two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?  Initially, determine the total number of treats made by Carly for her class by multiplying the number of individuals in the class by the treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats. Next, represent the brownies in relation to the cupcakes using the problem's details: b = 3c - 2, where b represents the brownies and c represents the cupcakes. Since b + c = 10, the total treats, substitute the expression for b into the equation: 3c - 2 + c = 10. Simplifying, we get 4c - 2 = 10. By adding two to both sides, we obtain 4c = 12.

How many more points does the class need to reach the 400-point threshold required for the trip?  Betty's 30% more points than Adam amount to 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 extra points. Hence, Betty's total is 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points. Tom, with 30 points fewer than Betty, has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points. Martha, with 3 times Tom's points, has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points. Altogether, the students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

Since each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt. With 10 beds, Bob will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt. As each bag contains 2 cubic feet, Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.

Given that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116. Substituting the first equation into the second, we have s + 5s - 4 = 116. When we simplify this, we get 6s - 4 = 116.

If the council consists of 33 individuals, how many votes were cast in favor of the new regulation?  Let V represent the number of votes against the new regulation. Since the votes in favor were twice as many, it can be expressed as V + 2V = 3V = 33. Hence, V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes were against the new regulation.

Initially, determine the night-time temperature by subtracting 33 degrees from 45 degrees: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees. Subsequently, calculate the temperature difference Carson needs to generate to avert the pipes from freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees.

Next, calculate the time spent writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Following this, find the weekly time spent on makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week. Sum the time for videos and song-writing to get the total weekly time spent on TikTok: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week.

Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 small shirts. She also ordered 22 - 4 = <<22-4=18>>18 medium shirts, 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 large shirts, and 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 extra-large shirts. In total, Krissa ordered 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = <<11+22+18+9+15=75>>75 shirts.\n#### 75",

Mr. Jackson will require 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks in total. By dividing the total number of glue sticks by the quantity in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs are needed.

If Topher's shoe measures 8 feet and 4 inches, it equals (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches. Assuming the length of one of Bobby's shoes is x inches, the equation representing Topher's shoe length is 9*x + 10 = 100. By subtracting 10 from both sides, we simplify the expression to 9x = 90.
