On the other hand, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and three times as many from the shortest trees. Given that the total number of apples gathered by the sisters is 500, how many apples did Joanne pick from the average trees?  Joanne collected 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister picked 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees. Hence, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples. Joanne's total from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples. Therefore, the combined total of the sisters so far is 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.

Initially, calculate the total height contributed by the 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches. Next, determine the total height from the 2-inch heels: 3 women * 2 inches/woman = <<3*2=6>>6 inches. Then, sum up the total height from each type of heel to get the combined total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches. Afterward, ascertain the total number of women at the party: 3 women + 3 women = <<3+3=6>>6 women.

If he buys 4 packs of bagels, he is entitled to a 10% discount. What will be the cost of each individual bagel after ordering 4 packs?  Ordering 4 packs of bagels at $10.00 each results in 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00. With a 10% discount on the $40.00 purchase, the discount is 40 * 0.10 = $4.00. As a result, the total cost after the discount is 40 - 4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he purchased 4 packs, there are a total of 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels.

Next, calculate her current weekly expenses by multiplying this figure by the cost per trip: 10 trips per week * $2.20 per trip = $<<10*2.20=22>>22 per week. Finally, deduct the weekly bus pass cost from this amount to ascertain her savings: $22 per week - $20 per week = $<<22-20=2>>2.\n#### 2",

The original price of each box is $100.00, but currently has a 10% discount. If he decides to buy 2 boxes of contacts, what will be the cost of each pair of contacts?  With a 10% discount, each $100.00 box has $100.00 * 0.10 = $<<100.00 * 0.10=10.00>>10.00 off. Consequently, each box will cost $100.00 - $10.00 = $<<100.00 - 10=90.00>>90.00. Since Pete purchases 2 boxes at $90.00 each, the total cost amounts to 2 * $90 = $<<2 * 90=180.00>>180.00. Each box contains 90 contacts, and since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 90 * 2 = <<90 * 2=180>>180 contacts. As he needs 1 contact per eye, with 180 contacts, he will have 180 / 2 = <<180 / 2=90>>90 pairs of contacts.

Given his $25,000 yearly job prior to college, and assuming his degree triples his earnings, how long will it take for him to recoup the money lost from not working during school and the loan expenses?  With his income tripling to $25,000 x 3 = $<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year, he gains an additional $75,000 - $25,000 = $<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 yearly. The total loan amount is $50,000 x 4 = $<<50000*4=200000>>200,000, and the income lost from not working during college is $25,000 x 4 = $<<25000*4=100000>>100,000. Therefore, he needs to earn $200,000 + $100,000 = $<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000 in total. Consequently, it will take him $300,000 / $50,000 = <<300000/50000=6>>6 years to reach this goal.\n#### 6",

What is the total cost of Bill's new truck in dollars?  The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which amounts to $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2,500. The running boards are priced at $500 less than the leather seats, costing $2,500-$500=$<<2500-500=2000>>2,000. The total cost of the truck equals $30,000+$7,500+$2,500+$2,000+$1,500=$<<30000+7500+2500+2000+1500=43500>>43,500.\n#### 43,500",

Given that he watched a total of 7 hours of TV and that he watched a few 30-minute episodes on Wednesday, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on that day?  Let W represent the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday. Following his TV viewing schedule for the week, he had 7 - 1 = 6 hours of TV left after Monday, 5 hours left after Tuesday, and 3 1/2 hours left after Thursday. By Friday, he was left with 1 1/2 hours of TV time. Since each 30-minute episode is equivalent to 1/2 hour, the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.\n#### 3",

If the number of white chickens exceeds the number of red chickens by two, how many red chickens does Jerry have?  Begin by setting up the equation for the eggs laid each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r represents the red chickens and w represents the white ones. Next, express r in terms of w using the given information: w = r + <<+2=2>>2. Substitute r + 2 for w in the egg equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. Expand by multiplying 5 across the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. Combine like terms to simplify to 8r + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 8r = 32. Lastly, dividing both sides by 8 reveals that r = 4.\n#### 4",

On the other hand, the second venue costs $25 for each guest. While the first venue requires an additional $5 per person for food, the second venue includes food in its price. How many guests are needed for the costs of the two venues to be the same?  The total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5*X, where X represents the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be stated as 25*X. To determine the number of guests required for the costs to be equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other, resulting in the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X. Simplifying this equation leads to 200 = 20*X after subtracting 5*X from both sides. Therefore, X = 200/20 = 10, meaning that the costs will be equal when there are 10 guests.\n#### 10",

If they stay for 3 days, what is the total cost of the trip?  The hotel room costs $1500 * 0.2 = $<<1500*0.2=300>>300 more per night than the normal price, making it $1500 + $300 = $<<1500+300=1800>>1800 per night. Therefore, for 3 nights, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $<<1800*3=5400>>5400. The plane tickets amount to $5000 * 2 = $<<5000*2=10000>>10,000.

Then, determine the number of fireworks Hannah can see by multiplying this total by the percentage she can view: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks. Next, ascertain the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks. Finally, add the city's fireworks to Hannah's personal fireworks to find the total number: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks.\n#### 135",

Despite the city council's refusal to repair it, Ron plans to fix it himself. However, he will face a $120 fine for unauthorized road maintenance. Additionally, he needs to purchase 3 buckets of asphalt priced at $25 each. How much money will Ron save by taking matters into his own hands and fixing the pothole?  By multiplying the number of buckets needed by the cost per bucket, Ron's total expense for the asphalt is 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75. Deducting the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the potential car damage cost, we get $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255.\n#### 255",

To find the calorie count in a mini cinnamon roll, divide 600 calories by 3, resulting in 200 calories. Then, multiply this by the number of mini cinnamon rolls: 200 calories/roll * 200 rolls = 40000 calories. Next, determine the calories in a mini blueberry muffin by dividing 450 calories by 3, resulting in 150 calories. Multiply this by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = 45000 calories.

Following the baking, he opens a window for 30 minutes, with the house cooling down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window remains open. What is the final temperature of the house?  The temperature increase due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees. Adding this to the initial temperature gives 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees. Dividing the window open time by 10 minutes reveals there are 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3 intervals of 2-degree decreases. Multiplying the number of decreases by the decrease amount results in 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.

What is the total amount Daniel needs to pay for all the items he wants to purchase?  The cost of five notebooks is $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50. For two pens, it is 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.50>>0.50. Adding up all the costs, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30. Hence, the total discount amounts to 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3. Therefore, Daniel needs to pay $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 for all the items he wishes to buy.\n#### 27",

The prices of marigolds, petunias, and begonias are $2.74, $1.87, and $2.12 per pot, respectively. Today, Artie decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar due to a lack of change. If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he earn?  Artie will adjust the price of marigolds from $2.74 to $3 by rounding up since the digit following the 2 is 5 or higher. The price of petunias will be rounded up from $1.87 to $2 as the digit following the 1 is 5 or higher. The price of begonias will be rounded down from $2.12 to $2 because the digit following the 2 is less than 5. Calculating, Artie will earn $36 for selling 12 marigolds, $18 for selling 9 petunias, and $34 for selling 17 begonias, totaling $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.\n#### 88",

Even if the regular teacher shows up, there is a 40% chance that she will offer an extension to everyone. In the case where the class does not receive an extension, there is a 20% chance that Marcus can persuade the teacher that his dog destroyed his homework and receive a personal extension. What is the probability that Marcus will have to submit his homework tomorrow?  Begin by determining the likelihood of the regular teacher arriving by deducting the chance she won't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%. Then, calculate the probability that the teacher will not grant the class an extension by subtracting the probability she will from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%. Next, calculate the probability that Marcus will not receive a personal extension by subtracting the probability he will from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%. Now, find the probability that the teacher arrives AND doesn't give an extension to the class by multiplying the two separate probabilities: 0.6 * 0.5 = <<0.6*0.5=0.3>>0.3. Multiply this probability by the probability that Marcus won't receive a personal extension to determine the likelihood he has to turn in his homework: 0.3 * 0.8 = <<0.3*0.8=0.24>>0.24. Lastly, convert the decimal probability to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.24 * 100% = <<0.24*100=24>>24%.\n#### 24",

If Nathan releases the ball from the third-story balcony in the mall, where each story measures 24 feet in height, how high does the ball bounce on its second rebound?  Initially, determine the total distance from which Nathan releases the ball: 24 feet per story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet. Then, calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce by multiplying this figure by 2/3: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet.

However, his research lasted 10 times longer than expected, with each month beyond the initial 5 requiring 50% more funding. What was the total cost of his research?  The extended research duration was 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months. Therefore, the more expensive research phase lasted for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months. Initially, each month of research cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000. Subsequently, the more expensive phase cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000 per month. Consequently, the total cost of the more expensive research phase was 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000.

If all the baked items are laid end to end, what will be the total length in feet?  First, calculate the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches. Next, determine the total length of the croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = <<120*6=720>>720 inches. Add the lengths of the rolls and croissants to get the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches. Divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet. Then, find the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet. Add the lengths of the other baked goods in feet to find the overall length: 120 feet + 160 feet = <<120+160=280>>280 feet.\n#### 280",

Starting with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers, Lorraine swaps 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, and 50% of her large stickers for large buttons with the remaining traded for small buttons. How many buttons does Lorraine end up with?  Lorraine trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27. As a result, she receives 9 large buttons for these trades because 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9. Trading 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x .5 = 20, she acquires 20 large buttons since 20 / 1 = <<20/1=20>>20. She further exchanges 50% of her large stickers for small buttons because 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50. By trading 20 large stickers for small buttons, she gains 60 small buttons since 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60.

She accurately answers 80% of the multiple-choice questions, 90% of the true/false questions, and 60% of the long-answer questions. The multiple-choice and true/false questions carry a value of 1 point each, while the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each. If there are 10 multiple-choice questions, 20 true/false questions, and 5 long-answer questions, how many points does Amy score in total?  Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 multiple-choice questions, which is 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions. She also correctly answers 90% of 20 true/false questions, which is 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions. Adding these together, she answered a total of 8 + 18 = <<8+18=26>>26 questions correctly, which translates to 26 points. For the 5 long-answer questions, she correctly answers 60% * 5 questions = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions. These long-answer questions are worth 5 points each, so 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points. Adding the points from the multiple-choice and true/false questions to the points from the long-answer questions, Amy's total score is 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points.\n#### 41",

How many cases of shingles are needed for the third house?  Let x represent the number of shingles cases for the second house. The first house requires (1/2)x cases of shingles, and the third house needs 2 times the shingles required for the first house, which equals x cases. The total shingles needed across the three houses is 250 cases, so x + x + (1/2)x = 250. Solving for x gives x = 100, which means the third house requires 100 cases of shingles.\n#### 100",

She bought 5 packs of bacon for $10 total, 6 packets of chicken priced at twice the cost of bacon, 3 packs of strawberries for $4 each, and 7 packs of apples at half the price of strawberries. How much money, in dollars, does Kelly have remaining in her budget?  Kelly spent $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2 on each pack of bacon. Consequently, each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4. The total cost of the chicken is 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24. The strawberries cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12. Each pack of apples costs $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2. Therefore, all the apples amount to 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14. In total, Kelly spent $10 on bacon + $24 on chicken + $12 on strawberries + $14 on apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60. Hence, she has $65 budget - $60 spent = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in her budget.\n#### 5",

After reviewing the recipe, she learned that it would take 20 minutes to prepare the batter, 30 minutes to bake, 2 hours to cool, and an extra 10 minutes to frost the cake. If Jordan intends to make the cake on the same day and have it ready to serve by 5:00 pm, what is the latest time she can begin preparing the cake?  Since 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes, 2 hours for the cake to cool translates to 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Adding up the time it takes for each step, which is 20 minutes for batter, 30 minutes for baking, 120 minutes for cooling, and 10 minutes for frosting, the total time needed is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes. Converting 180 minutes to hours gives 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours. If the cake must be ready by 5:00 pm and it requires 3 hours to make, Jordan should start no later than 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm.\n#### 2",

For the remaining 400 movies not in series, 40% or 400*0.4=<<400*0.4=160>>160 are old, totaling 160*5=$<<160*5=800>>800. The 240 movies left, which are neither old nor in series, cost 240*10=$<<240*10=2400>>2400. Therefore, the total cost amounts to 1200+800+2400=$<<1200+800+2400=4400>>4400.\n#### 4400",

Each performing group requires 2 minutes to enter the stage, 6 minutes for their performance, and 2 minutes to exit. Additionally, there will be a 10-minute break during the concert. How many groups can Vicki accommodate in the concert?  To facilitate our calculations, we need to convert the 2-hour showtime into minutes. Since an hour consists of 60 minutes, the total concert duration will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Deducting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes available for performances. Considering each group needs 2 minutes to enter, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling 10 minutes per group. With 110 minutes for performances in total, we can accommodate 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = <<110/10=11>>11 groups in the concert.\n#### 11",

The pass rate for the fifth graders was twice that of the fourth graders. What is the overall pass rate for the school?  Begin by calculating the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4. Next, double this rate to determine the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8. Then, multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders. Add up the number of passing students from each grade to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students. Calculate the total number of students by adding the number of students in each grade: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students. Finally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students, and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of students who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%.\n#### 70",

The blue rope is Y - 7 cm, and the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7) cm. When the lengths are added together, it equals 37 cm, resulting in 6Y - 35 = 37. Solving this equation gives Y = 12 cm.

Job B offers a flat salary of $42,000 each year, but is located in a state that levies $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on the remaining income post-property tax. How much more money will Nick earn at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job?  To begin, determine Nick's gross annual income for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000. Then, calculate the tax amount Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: 0.2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000. Deduct Nick's taxes from his net income to derive his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000. Subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross earnings at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000. Next, multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to ascertain his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600. Subtract the income tax from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400. Finally, subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income of the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400.\n#### 8400",

Since y is double what he saved per day in the first half, he saved y/2 per day in the first half. With April having 30 days, 15 in each half, he saves (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half, totaling (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125.

Initially, he benefited from a special offer where the first 6 months cost $8 per month, after which it increased to the regular price of $12 per month. Following 8 months at the standard rate, the service further raised its price to $14 per month. How much did Bill spend on a 2-year subscription to the service?  Since a year consists of 12 months, there are a total of 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years. Out of these 24 months, Bill paid the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months. He made payments at the special rate of $8 per month for 6 months, resulting in 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48. For 8 months at the normal rate of $12 per month, he paid 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96. Subsequently, at the new rate of $14 per month, he paid $14 per month for 10 months, amounting to 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140. Therefore, over the course of two years, his total expenditure was $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.\n#### 284",

How much longer does it take to complete a ride on the longest slide compared to the second longest slide?  To calculate the duration of a ride on the longest slide, divide the length of 300 feet by the rate of 60 feet per minute: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes. Next, determine the ride duration of the second longest slide by dividing the length of 240 feet by the rate of 80 feet per minute: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes.

Therefore, he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch. Moreover, for the 4 regular gallons of lemonade, each needing 1 cup of juice, he will require 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups in total. Consequently, the total amount of juice needed will be 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups. Given that each cup necessitates 6 lemons and he needs 6 cups of juice, the number of lemons required is 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36.\n#### 36",

The rats are divided into 3 cages with an equal number in each cage, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. The hamsters are individually kept in 10 cages, with each hamster getting 5 pieces of straw. The rabbits, on the other hand, have 20 pieces of straw distributed among them. Given that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been given to these small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?  The hamster cages account for 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw. When combining the straw for the hamsters and rabbits, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw. With the remaining straw for the rats, they have a total of 160 pieces of straw - 70 pieces of straw allocated for hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straw. Thus, in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw. This implies that each cage accommodates 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.\n#### 5",

Initially, Sally had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, totaling 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons. After 40% of the red balloons burst, she had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.

Hence, over 52 weeks (1 year), he does 3 loads per week, resulting in a total of 52*3 = <<3*52=156>>156 loads of laundry.\n#### 156",

Overall, from these back and forth runs, she covers 2720 yards (34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720). Therefore, her total distance is 2920 yards (2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920).

With the addition of 18 new plants, her total count became 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants. When she gives away 40 plants the following day, she will have 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants remaining.\n#### 58",

How much more profit will Fern generate from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if it operates continuously for 24 hours a day over a month with 30 days?  Calculate the additional number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour. Then, determine the daily discrepancy by multiplying this difference by the number of hours in a day: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day. Next, find the monthly difference by multiplying the daily variance by the number of days in a month: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month. Finally, compute the total earnings difference by multiplying the number of widgets by the selling price per widget: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800.\n#### 64800",

If there are 64 student cars, each with four windows, and 32 teacher cars, each with two windows, how many windows does Hannah break?  To determine the number of student cars Hannah smashed, multiply 64 cars by 1/4 to get 16 cars. Then, to find the number of teacher cars she smashed, multiply 32 cars by 3/4 to get 24 cars. Next, calculate the total number of windows smashed on the students' cars by multiplying 16 cars by 4 windows per car to get 64 windows. Similarly, for the teachers' cars, multiply 24 cars by 2 windows per car to get 48 windows. Finally, add the total number of windows smashed on the students' and teachers' cars together to find the overall number of windows smashed: 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.\n#### 112",

After growing, Xavier reached a height of 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches, while Cole grew to 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.

After incorporating the cream, Shannon's iced coffee becomes 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.\n#### 75",

Among the blue-dressed babies and 1/3 of the purple-dressed babies, they are adorned with bows. What is the percentage probability that a baby wearing a bow is also dressed in purple?  First, determine the number of babies dressed in purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies. Then, calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and wearing bows by multiplying: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies. Next, find the number of babies dressed in blue by subtracting the purple-wearing babies from the total: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies. Finally, to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is dressed in purple, divide the number of purple bow-wearing babies by the total bow-wearing babies: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%.\n#### 50",

How much money does Brady have in his piggy bank in terms of dollars?  With each penny equivalent to 1 cent, 100 pennies amount to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents. Since a nickel is worth 5 cents, 40 nickels total to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents. Similarly, with a dime worth 10 cents, 20 dimes sum up to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents. Therefore, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents. Since a dollar equals 100 cents, 500 cents equates to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars. Consequently, Brady has $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.\n#### 45",

Then, represent the number of brownies in relation to cupcakes using the provided information: b = 3c - 2, where b represents brownies and c represents cupcakes. Given that b + c = 10, the total treats, substitute the expression for b from the previous step: 3c - 2 + c = 10.

Given b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116, substituting the first equation into the second yields s + 5s - 4 = 116. Simplifying, we find 6s - 4 = 116. By adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120.

Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans. Therefore, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.

Each adult bowl corresponds to 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children's bowls. Calvin and his wife consume two adult bowls, equivalent to 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children's bowls.

In addition, she dedicates 2 hours weekly to composing songs for her videos and spends 15 minutes on makeup six days a week before recording. How many minutes does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?  Initially, find the total time Britany spends recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes. Then, calculate the time spent on songwriting in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Subsequently, determine the weekly makeup time: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week. After summing the time for videos, songwriting, and makeup, the total weekly time on TikTok is: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week. Finally, multiplying the weekly time by the number of weeks in a month gives the total time spent in a month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month.\n#### 1128",

Adding the minimum monthly payments of $300 + $200 + $500 = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000, then calculating 50% of that total as an additional payment results in $1000 * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500 extra per month. Combining this with the minimum total gives a monthly payment of $1000 + $500 = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500.

For every 2 yards of material, she can produce 4 small masks and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. If she needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks for her class, how much material will she need in total?  It will take 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards per small mask. Similarly, 2.25 yards of material / 3 large masks = <<2.25/3=0.75>>0.75 yards per large mask. Therefore, for the 20 small masks, she will require 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material. For the 8 large masks, she will need 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material. In total, she will need 10 yards + 6 yards = <<10+6=16>>16 yards of material.\n#### 16",

With Topher's shoe being 8 feet and 4 inches long, it converts to (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches. Assuming the length of one of Bobby's shoes is x inches, the equation representing Topher's shoe length is 9*x + 10 = 100. By subtracting 10 from both sides, the equation simplifies to 9x = 90.

It stops producing fruits in its ninth year but produces twenty times the initial amount when it reaches 10 years. How many total fruits can an avocado tree yield over its 10 years of life?  At 5 years, it produces 50 fruits. At 6 years, it yields 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits. By the time it's 7 years old, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits.

Subsequently, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, and 5/8 of the remaining ones featured the letter C, with the remainder showing the letter D. How many cards had the letter D on them?  The number of cards with the letter A is 2/5*80 = <<2/5*80=32>>32 cards. After deducting these, there were 80-32 = <<80-32=48>>48 cards left without a letter. Half of these cards had the letter B, which is 1/2*48 = 24 cards. The remaining cards without B amounted to 48-24 = <<48-24=24>>24. If 5/8 of these had the letter C, then there were 5/8*24 = <<5/8*24=15>>15 cards with the letter C. Consequently, the number of cards with the letter D is 24-15 = <<24-15=9>>9.\n#### 9",
