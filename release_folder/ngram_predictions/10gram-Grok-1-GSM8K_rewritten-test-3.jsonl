Given that the total number of apples gathered by the sisters is 500, how many apples did Joanne pick from the average trees?  Joanne collected 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister picked 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees. Hence, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples. Joanne's total from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.

The quantities used are as follows: the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she utilize?  Tanya uses Z ounces of zest. Consequently, she uses 2Z fragrance and zest. Utilizing 2Z salt and 2Z sugar, the total comes to 6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar. Given that she uses 4Z oil, the overall sum is 10Z, which equals 10 ounces. Therefore, she uses 1 ounce of zest. Hence, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.\n#### 4",

Ordering 4 packs of bagels at $10.00 each results in 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00. With a 10% discount on the $40.00 purchase, the discount is 40 * 0.10 = $4.00.

The total wage payout for the second month is 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000. Upon hiring 20 more employees in the third month, the total workforce amounts to 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees. The total wages paid in the third month sum up to 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000. Therefore, the cumulative payment over the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000.\n#### 2880000",

His total cost will be 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos. Therefore, Cameron will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.\n#### 250",

After paying the bill, he has $25 left because 125 - 100 = <<125-100=25>>25.\n#### 25",

If the number of white chickens exceeds the number of red chickens by two, how many red chickens does Jerry have?  Begin by setting up the equation for the eggs laid each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r represents the red chickens and w represents the white ones. Next, express r in terms of w using the given information: w = r + <<+2=2>>2. Substitute r + 2 for w in the egg equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. Expand by multiplying 5 across the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. Combine like terms to simplify to 8r + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 8r = 32. Lastly, dividing both sides by 8 reveals that r = 4.\n#### 4",

On the other hand, the second venue costs $25 for each guest. While the first venue requires an additional $5 per person for food, the second venue includes food in its price. How many guests are needed for the costs of the two venues to be the same?  The total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5*X, where X represents the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be stated as 25*X. To determine the number of guests required for the costs to be equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other, resulting in the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X. Simplifying this equation leads to 200 = 20*X after subtracting 5*X from both sides. Therefore, X = 200/20 = 10, meaning that the costs will be equal when there are 10 guests.\n#### 10",

After purchasing 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples, how many plums can he afford?  Jamaar spent $3.5 on peaches and pears as 7 x $0.5 = $3.5. He also used $2 on kiwis, calculated as 2 x $1 = $2. Additionally, he spent $3.75 on apples as 5 x $0.75 = $3.75. Having already spent $9.25, computed as $3.5 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25, he can buy three plums since $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.\n#### 3",

What is the total number of fireworks that Hannah will witness?  Start by calculating the total number of fireworks the city will launch: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks. Then, determine the number of fireworks Hannah can see by multiplying this total by the percentage she can view: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks. Next, ascertain the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks.

After a 10-hour shift, they are still 20 toys short. What is the production rate per hour of the fifth worker?  The first group of workers made 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys each, totaling 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys. The second group made 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys each, totaling 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys. Combined, the two groups produced 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys. If they still lack 20 toys to complete the order, they have made 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys. The fifth worker contributed 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total. Hence, the fifth worker's production rate is 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.\n#### 18",

Following the baking, he opens a window for 30 minutes, with the house cooling down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window remains open. What is the final temperature of the house?  The temperature increase due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees. Adding this to the initial temperature gives 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees. Dividing the window open time by 10 minutes reveals there are 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3 intervals of 2-degree decreases. Multiplying the number of decreases by the decrease amount results in 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees. Subtracting this from the post-baking temperature provides the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees.\n#### 49",

Daniel, an engineering student, intends to purchase five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The store offers a 10% discount on all the items. What is the total amount Daniel needs to pay for all the items he wants to purchase?  The cost of five notebooks is $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50. For two pens, it is 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.50>>0.50. Adding up all the costs, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.

The prices of marigolds, petunias, and begonias are $2.74, $1.87, and $2.12 per pot, respectively. Today, Artie decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar due to a lack of change. If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he earn?  Artie will adjust the price of marigolds from $2.74 to $3 by rounding up since the digit following the 2 is 5 or higher. The price of petunias will be rounded up from $1.87 to $2 as the digit following the 1 is 5 or higher. The price of begonias will be rounded down from $2.12 to $2 because the digit following the 2 is less than 5. Calculating, Artie will earn $36 for selling 12 marigolds, $18 for selling 9 petunias, and $34 for selling 17 begonias, totaling $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.\n#### 88",

Even if the regular teacher shows up, there is a 40% chance that she will offer an extension to everyone. In the case where the class does not receive an extension, there is a 20% chance that Marcus can persuade the teacher that his dog destroyed his homework and receive a personal extension. What is the probability that Marcus will have to submit his homework tomorrow?  Begin by determining the likelihood of the regular teacher arriving by deducting the chance she won't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%. Then, calculate the probability that the teacher will not grant the class an extension by subtracting the probability she will from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%. Next, calculate the probability that Marcus will not receive a personal extension by subtracting the probability he will from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%. Now, find the probability that the teacher arrives AND doesn't give an extension to the class by multiplying the two separate probabilities: 0.6 * 0.5 = <<0.6*0.5=0.3>>0.3. Multiply this probability by the probability that Marcus won't receive a personal extension to determine the likelihood he has to turn in his homework: 0.3 * 0.8 = <<0.3*0.8=0.24>>0.24. Lastly, convert the decimal probability to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.24 * 100% = <<0.24*100=24>>24%.\n#### 24",

If he takes a 20% break during the days between March 1st and April 19th and aids people on all other days, how many individuals does he assist? (Note: March has 31 days.)  Initially, calculate the total days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days. Next, determine the percentage of time Billy works by subtracting his time off percentage from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%. Then, multiply this by 80% to find the days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days. Afterward, calculate the number of individuals Billy assists daily: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day. Finally, multiply the daily number of people assisted by the days he works to determine the total number of individuals he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people.\n#### 240",

In the barter, a large sticker is equivalent to a large button or three small buttons, while a small sticker is traded for one small button. Additionally, a large button is exchanged for three small stickers. Starting with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers, Lorraine swaps 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, and 50% of her large stickers for large buttons with the remaining traded for small buttons. How many buttons does Lorraine end up with?  Lorraine trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27. As a result, she receives 9 large buttons for these trades because 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9. Trading 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x .5 = 20, she acquires 20 large buttons since 20 / 1 = <<20/1=20>>20. She further exchanges 50% of her large stickers for small buttons because 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50. By trading 20 large stickers for small buttons, she gains 60 small buttons since 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60. Consequently, Lorraine ends up with 89 buttons because 9 + 20 + 60 = <<9+20+60=89>>89.\n#### 89",

Similarly, calculate the slices in 1/4 of the pizza: 12 slices * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 slices. Then, subtract the slices eaten by the three individuals to find the remaining slices: 12 slices - 4 slices - 3 slices - 2 slices = <<12-4-3-2=3>>3 slices.\n#### 3",

Start by calculating the total number of guests from the 6-member families: 2 families * 6 members/family = <<2*6=12>>12 people. Next, determine the total number of guests from the 4-member families: 3 families * 4 members/family = <<3*4=12>>12 people. Combine these two figures to find the total guests invited by Martha: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people. Then, identify the number of guests unable to attend due to illness: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people.

Consequently, each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4. The total cost of the chicken is 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24. The strawberries cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12. Each pack of apples costs $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2. Therefore, all the apples amount to 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14. In total, Kelly spent $10 on bacon + $24 on chicken + $12 on strawberries + $14 on apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60. Hence, she has $65 budget - $60 spent = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in her budget.\n#### 5",

If Jordan intends to make the cake on the same day and have it ready to serve by 5:00 pm, what is the latest time she can begin preparing the cake?  Since 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes, 2 hours for the cake to cool translates to 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Adding up the time it takes for each step, which is 20 minutes for batter, 30 minutes for baking, 120 minutes for cooling, and 10 minutes for frosting, the total time needed is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes. Converting 180 minutes to hours gives 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours.

Since an hour consists of 60 minutes, the total concert duration will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Deducting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes available for performances. Considering each group needs 2 minutes to enter, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit, totaling 10 minutes per group.

The pass rate for the fifth graders was twice that of the fourth graders. What is the overall pass rate for the school?  Begin by calculating the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4. Next, double this rate to determine the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8. Then, multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders. Add up the number of passing students from each grade to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students. Calculate the total number of students by adding the number of students in each grade: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students. Finally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students, and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of students who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%.\n#### 70",

The initial shipping cost for the book based on weight is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40, and the cost based on distance is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60.

Job B offers a flat salary of $42,000 each year, but is located in a state that levies $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on the remaining income post-property tax. How much more money will Nick earn at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job?  To begin, determine Nick's gross annual income for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000. Then, calculate the tax amount Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: 0.2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000. Deduct Nick's taxes from his net income to derive his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000. Subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross earnings at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000. Next, multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to ascertain his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600. Subtract the income tax from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400. Finally, subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income of the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400.\n#### 8400",

Lee has a total of g + s = 20 animals on the farm. Consequently, Lee has s = 20 - g sheep. The animals possess 2g + 4s = 70 legs. Substituting the value of s obtained earlier, we have 2g + 4(20-g) = 70. This simplifies to 2g + 80 - 4g = 70, which further simplifies to 2g = 10. Therefore, there are 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.

How much longer does it take to complete a ride on the longest slide compared to the second longest slide?  To calculate the duration of a ride on the longest slide, divide the length of 300 feet by the rate of 60 feet per minute: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes. Next, determine the ride duration of the second longest slide by dividing the length of 240 feet by the rate of 80 feet per minute: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes.

The hamsters are individually kept in 10 cages, with each hamster getting 5 pieces of straw. The rabbits, on the other hand, have 20 pieces of straw distributed among them. Given that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been given to these small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?  The hamster cages account for 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw. When combining the straw for the hamsters and rabbits, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw. With the remaining straw for the rats, they have a total of 160 pieces of straw - 70 pieces of straw allocated for hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straw. Thus, in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw. This implies that each cage accommodates 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.\n#### 5",

Blake completes 15 round trips, while Kelly initially runs one round trip but then decides to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much more distance does the winner cover compared to the loser?  For each round trip, Blake covers 200 yards (100 x 2 = 200). In total, he runs 3000 yards (200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000). Initially, Kelly covers 200 yards (100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200). Each time she runs back and forth to the 40-yard line, she covers 80 yards (40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80). Overall, from these back and forth runs, she covers 2720 yards (34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720). Therefore, her total distance is 2920 yards (2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920).

Calculate the additional number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour. Then, determine the daily discrepancy by multiplying this difference by the number of hours in a day: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day. Next, find the monthly difference by multiplying the daily variance by the number of days in a month: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month. Finally, compute the total earnings difference by multiplying the number of widgets by the selling price per widget: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800.\n#### 64800",

To determine the number of student cars Hannah smashed, multiply 64 cars by 1/4 to get 16 cars. Then, to find the number of teacher cars she smashed, multiply 32 cars by 3/4 to get 24 cars. Next, calculate the total number of windows smashed on the students' cars by multiplying 16 cars by 4 windows per car to get 64 windows. Similarly, for the teachers' cars, multiply 24 cars by 2 windows per car to get 48 windows.

First, determine the number of babies dressed in purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies. Then, calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and wearing bows by multiplying: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies.

Finally, to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is dressed in purple, divide the number of purple bow-wearing babies by the total bow-wearing babies: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%.\n#### 50",

Sweet potato vines, priced at $2.50 each and requiring 2 per basket, will cost 2.5*2 = $<<2.5*2=5.00>>5.00.

Initially, determine the time required for Emily to peel all the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes. Next, ascertain the number of batches of shrimp she has to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches. Then, calculate the total cooking time by multiplying the number of batches by the time per batch: 3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes. Finally, add the peeling time to determine the total time Emily will spend: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes.\n#### 45",

Traveling 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles daily implies he covers 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles weekly. Consequently, his weekly payment for driving is $300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600. Thus, his yearly expense for miles traveled amounts to $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30,000. Moreover, he provides a $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1,800 yearly bonus to his driver.

Then, represent the number of brownies in relation to cupcakes using the provided information: b = 3c - 2, where b represents brownies and c represents cupcakes. Given that b + c = 10, the total treats, substitute the expression for b from the previous step: 3c - 2 + c = 10.

The total volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = <<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches. This means the jar can accommodate 540 / 0.15 = <<540/0.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans. Considering the 80% packing efficiency, the jar can hold 3600 * 0.8 = <<3600*0.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans. Therefore, Tim's estimate is that 2880 * 0.3 = <<2880*0.3=864>>864 of them are red.

The average loss per race was $3 because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3.\n#### 3",

Let x represent the length of the fence allocated to Sam and y represent the length given to Harry. Since y = x + 60 and y + x = 100, substituting the first equation into the second gives 2x + 60 = 100. By subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40. Dividing both sides by two results in x = 20. Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of the fence left.\n#### 20",

Adding two to this gives the total before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12. Since 2/3 * x = 12, where x represents the original number of vacuum cleaners, dividing both sides by 2/3 shows that x = 18.\n#### 18",

In addition, she dedicates 2 hours weekly to composing songs for her videos and spends 15 minutes on makeup six days a week before recording. How many minutes does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?  Initially, find the total time Britany spends recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes. Then, calculate the time spent on songwriting in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Subsequently, determine the weekly makeup time: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week. After summing the time for videos, songwriting, and makeup, the total weekly time on TikTok is: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week. Finally, multiplying the weekly time by the number of weeks in a month gives the total time spent in a month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month.\n#### 1128",

Each worker was paid $15 * 40 = $600 per week upon hiring.\nThe total earnings for a worker under contract in a month amount to 4 weeks * $600 per week = $2400.\nFor May, with 40 employees, the company paid 40 * $2400 = $96000 to all its contracted workers.\nIn June, as 1/4 of the workers' contracts were not renewed, this affected 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees.\nIn June, there were 40 - 10 = 30 workers still under contract.\nThe total payment to the contracted workers in June was 30 * $2400 = $72000.\nOver the two months, the company paid a total of $72000 + $96000 = $168000.\n#### 168000",

With Topher's shoe being 8 feet and 4 inches long, it converts to (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches. Assuming the length of one of Bobby's shoes is x inches, the equation representing Topher's shoe length is 9*x + 10 = 100. By subtracting 10 from both sides, the equation simplifies to 9x = 90.

It stops producing fruits in its ninth year but produces twenty times the initial amount when it reaches 10 years. How many total fruits can an avocado tree yield over its 10 years of life?  At 5 years, it produces 50 fruits. At 6 years, it yields 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits. By the time it's 7 years old, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits.
