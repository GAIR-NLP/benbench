## Overview of GAIRMath-Abel-13b
The main script loads the GAIRMath-Abel-13b model and calculates its perplexity on two datasets: gsm8k_train.jsonl and gsm8k_test.jsonl. 

## Usage
Update the cuda device id.
Update the gsm8k_train.jsonl and gsm8k_test.jsonl dataset paths in the script to point to your local datasets.
Update the model_path in the script to point to your local model checkpoint.
