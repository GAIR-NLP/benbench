By problem and step 2, we know that the group has $450 left for the tickets. To find out how many tickets they can buy, we divide the amount they have left by the cost of each ticket: $450 / $20 = <<450/20=22.5>>22.5.\n4. Since they can't buy half a ticket, only whole numbers of tickets can be bought. Therefore, only <<int(22.5)=22>>22 students can go on the trip.\n5. [Final solution] Thus, the group can take 22 students on the trip.\n#### 22"}

Sara eats 15 apples and then her brother eats a third of the remaining oranges and adds 20 bananas. We need to find out the percentage chance that Sara will get an orange if she picks a fruit at random.\n2. To find the final number of apples, we subtract the number of apples Sara ate from the starting number: 50 apples - 15 apples = 35 apples.\n3. To find the final number of oranges, we subtract a third of the starting number of oranges: 50 oranges - (50 oranges / 3) = 33 oranges. (Note: dividing by 3 represents the brother eating a third of the remaining oranges)\n4. To find the total number of fruits at the end, we add the number of apples, oranges, and bananas: 35 apples + 33 oranges + 20 bananas = 88 fruits.\n5. To find the percentage chance that Sara gets an orange, we divide the number of oranges by the total number of fruits and then multiply by 100: 33 oranges / 88 fruits * 100 = 37.5%.\n6.

Let x represent the number of bands for Mike.\n3. By problem, Sarah saw half as many bands as Mike. Therefore, Sarah saw x/2 bands.\n4. By problem, John saw 3 bands more than twice the number of bands that Sarah saw. Since Sarah saw x/2 bands, John saw 3 + 2(x/2) = 3 + x bands.\n5. To find out the total number of bands, we add the number of bands that Mike, Sarah, and John saw together. By steps 2, 3, and 4, the equation is: x + (x/2) + (3 + x) = 50.\n6. To solve the equation, we combine like terms: (5/2)x + 3 = 50.\n7. Next, we isolate the variable x by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: (5/2)x = 47.\n8. To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (5/2), which is 2/5: x = 47 * (2/5) = 18.8 bands.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, Mike saw 19 bands. \n#### 19"}

The problem states that in a basketball game, the home team scored 5 points more than twice the points scored by the visiting team. We need to find out how many points did the home team score.\n2. Let X be the points scored by the visiting team.\n3. According to the problem, the home team scored 2 times the points scored by the visiting team plus 5. Therefore, the home team scored 2*X + 5 points.\n4. The total points scored in the game were 105. So, we can write the equation: X + 2*X + 5 = 105.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 3*X + 5 = 105.\n6. To solve for X, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 3*X + 5 - 5 = 105 - 5.\n7. Simplifying further, we have 3*X = 100.\n8. To find the value of X, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: (3*X) / 3 = 100 / 3.\n9. Simplifying, we get X = 100 / 3.\n10. To find out how many points the home team scored, we substitute the value of X into the expression 2*X + 5: 2 * (100 / 3) + 5 = 70.\n11.

To find out how many fully bloomed red roses there are, we multiply the number of red roses by 50%: 10 * 50% = <<10 * 0.5 = 5>>5 fully bloomed red roses.\n4. By problem and step 3, we know that 5 red roses are fully bloomed. Therefore, the remaining 5 - 5 = 0 red roses are buds.\n5. By problem, the red roses make up 70% of the total flowers in the garden. To find out the total number of roses, we divide the number of red roses by 70%: 10 / 0.7 = <<10 / 0.7 = 14.2857...>>14.2857..., which rounds up to 14 because the number of roses must be an integer.\n6. To find out the total number of flowers in the garden, we add the number of roses to the number of tulips. By step 5, there are 14 roses. By problem, the remaining flowers are tulips. Therefore, there are 14 + (100 - 70)% = 14 + 30% = 14 + 30/100 * 14 = 14 + (0.3 * 14) = 14 + 4.2 = <<14 + 4.2 = 18.2>>18.2 tulips.\n7. By step 6, there are 14 roses and 18.2 tulips in the garden. Since the number of flowers must be an integer, we round up the number of tulips to the nearest integer: 19.\n8. [Final solution] Thus, there are 14 roses and 19 tulips in the garden, for a total of 14 + 19 = 33 flowers. \n#### 33"}

Today, they sold twice as many cupcakes and half as many cakes as they did yesterday. How much total revenue did the bakery make from selling cupcakes and cakes over these two days?", "answer": "1. The problem states that a bakery sells cupcakes for $2 each and cakes for $20 each. Yesterday, they sold 15 cupcakes and 3 cakes. Today, they sold twice as many cupcakes and half as many cakes as they did yesterday. We need to find out the total revenue the bakery made from selling cupcakes and cakes over these two days.\n2. By problem, yesterday the bakery sold 15 cupcakes. To find out the cupcake revenue from yesterday, we multiply the number of cupcakes sold by the price per cupcake: 15 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $<<15*2=30>>30.\n3. By problem, yesterday the bakery sold 3 cakes. To find out the cake revenue from yesterday, we multiply the number of cakes sold by the price per cake: 3 cakes * $20/cake = $<<3*20=60>>60.\n4. To find out yesterday's total revenue, we add the cupcake revenue and the cake revenue together: $30 + $60 = $<<30+60=90>>90.\n5. By problem, today the bakery sold twice as many cupcakes as they did yesterday. Therefore, they sold 2 * 15 cupcakes = 30 cupcakes today. To find out the cupcake revenue from today, we multiply the number of cupcakes sold by the price per cupcake: 30 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $<<2*15*2=60>>60.\n6. By problem, today the bakery sold half as many cakes as they did yesterday. Therefore, they sold 0.5 * 3 cakes = 1.5 cakes today. However, we can't sell half a cake, so we round down to 1 cake. To find out the cake revenue from today, we multiply the number of cakes sold by the price per cake: 1 cake * $20/cake = $<<1*20=20>>20.\n7. To find out today's total revenue, we add the cupcake revenue and the cake revenue together: $60 + $20 = $<<60+20=80>>80.\n8. To find out the total revenue over these two days, we add yesterday's total revenue and today's total revenue together: $90 + $80 = $<<90+80=170>>170.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, the bakery made a total revenue of $170 from selling cupcakes and cakes over these two days. \n#### 170"}

The problem states that in a school, there are 120 students and the number of boys is 1/5 more than the number of girls. We need to find out how many more girls are there than the number of teachers if the number of teachers is 1/4 of the total number of students.\n2. By problem, the number of teachers is 1/4 of the total number of students. Therefore, the number of teachers is 120 / 4 = << 120 / 4 = 30 >> = 30.\n3. By problem, the number of boys is 1/5 more than the number of girls. Since there are 120 students and 30 teachers, there are 120 - 30 = << 120 - 30 = 90 >> = 90 students who are either boys or girls. Let's assume the number of girls is x. Then, the number of boys is x + 1/5 * x = 6/5 * x. Since the total number of students is 90, we have the equation x + 6/5 * x = 90. To solve for x, we simplify the equation: 11/5 * x = 90. We isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 11/5: x = 90 / (11/5) = 90 * (5/11) = << 90 * (5/11) = 45 >> = 45.\n4. By step 3, we found that the number of girls is 45. To find out the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 90 - 45 = << 90 - 45 = 45 >> = 45.\n5. By step 2, we found that the number of teachers is 30. To find out how many more girls there are than teachers, we subtract the number of teachers from the number of girls: 45 - 30 = << 45 - 30 = 15 >> = 15.\n6.

To find out the number of full-time employees, we subtract the number of part-time employees from the total number of employees: 120 - 30 = <<120-30=90>>90 full-time employees.\n4. By problem, the part-time employees currently work 3 days a week. To find out the total number of work days for the part-time employees, we multiply the number of part-time employees by the number of days they work: 30 * 3 = <<30*3=90>>90 days.\n5. By problem and step 3, we know that there are 90 full-time employees. To find out the total number of work days for the full-time employees, we multiply the number of full-time employees by the number of days they work: 90 * 5 = <<90*5=450>>450 days.\n6. To find out the total number of work days for the company currently, we add the number of work days for the part-time employees and the number of work days for the full-time employees: 90 + 450 = <<90+450=540>>540 work days.\n7. By problem, if all employees switch to a 4-day work week, the total work days will be 120 * 4 = <<120*4=480>>480.\n8. To find out how many work days the company will save each week, we subtract the total work days under the 4-day work week from the current total work days: 540 - 480 = <<540-480=60>>60 work days.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, the company will save 60 work days each week if they switch to a 4-day work week for all employees. \n#### 60"}

{"question": "Peter is buying books for his class. He finds a store selling 7 books for $14, and another one selling 4 books for $10. Assuming he wants to buy 15 of the cheaper books, how much would Peter spend in dollars?", "answer": "1. The problem states that Peter is buying books for his class. He found two stores selling books at different prices. One store is selling 7 books for $14, and the other store is selling 4 books for $10. Peter wants to buy 15 of the cheaper books, and we need to find out how much he would spend in dollars.\n2. To determine which store sells the cheaper books individually, we divide the total price by the number of books in each store. In the first store, the price for 7 books is $14, so we perform the calculation 14 / 7 = <<14/7=2>>2 dollars per book.\n3. In the second store, the price for 4 books is $10, so we perform the calculation 10 / 4 = <<10/4=2.5>>2.5 dollars per book.\n4. Since $2 is less than $2.5, the books from the first store are cheaper individually.\n5. To determine the total amount Peter would spend, we multiply the price per book in the first store ($2) by the number of books he wants to buy (15). Therefore, we perform the calculation 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 dollars.\n6. [Final solution] Thus, Peter would spend $30 to buy 15 of the cheaper books. \n#### 30"}

Anna pays three times as much as Bob, and Bob pays twice as much as Charles. We need to find out how much Anna has to pay.\n2. Let x be the amount Charles pays.\n3. By problem, Bob pays twice as much as Charles. Therefore, Bob pays 2x.\n4. By problem, Anna pays three times as much as Bob. Therefore, Anna pays 3(2x) = 6x.\n5. By problem, the total cost of the vacation is $12000. Therefore, the sum of the amounts each person pays is x + 2x + 6x = 9x.\n6. To find the value of x, we set up an equation: 9x = 12000.\n7. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 9: x = 12000 / 9 = 1333.33.\n8. However, we need the quotient of all divisions to be an integer, so we round x down to the nearest whole dollar, which is $1333.\n9. To find out how much Anna has to pay, we multiply her share (6x) by the rounded value of x: 6(1333) = 7998 dollars.\n10. [Final solution] Thus, Anna has to pay $7998. \n#### 7998."}

{"question": "A factory produces 1200 toys every day. Due to a machine malfunction, the production drops by 15% for the next three days. The factory manager decides to increase the production by 20% for the following two days to make up for the loss. How many toys will the factory produce in total over these five days?", "answer": "1. The problem states that a factory produces 1200 toys every day. Due to a machine malfunction, the production drops by 15% for the next three days. The factory manager decides to increase the production by 20% for the following two days to make up for the loss. We need to find out how many toys the factory will produce in total over these five days.\n2. First, let's calculate the number of toys not produced due to the machine malfunction. To do this, we multiply the daily production of 1200 toys by 15%: 1200 * 15% = 1200 * 0.15 = 180 toys.\n3. Therefore, the number of toys produced each day during the machine malfunction is the daily production of 1200 toys minus the number of toys not produced: 1200 - 180 = 1020 toys.\n4. Over three days, the factory will produce a total of toys during the malfunction: 1020 toys * 3 days = 1020 * 3 = 3060 toys.\n5. Next, let's calculate the increased production per day after the malfunction is fixed. To do this, we multiply the daily production of 1200 toys by 20%: 1200 * 20% = 1200 * 0.20 = 240 toys.\n6. Therefore, the number of toys produced each day after the malfunction is fixed is the daily production of 1200 toys plus the increased production: 1200 + 240 = 1440 toys.\n7. Over two days, the factory will produce a total of toys after the malfunction is fixed: 1440 toys * 2 days = 1440 * 2 = 2880 toys.\n8. Finally, to find the total number of toys produced over the five days, we add the number of toys produced during the malfunction (3060 toys) and the number of toys produced after the malfunction is fixed (2880 toys): 3060 + 2880 = 5940 toys.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, the factory will produce a total of 5940 toys over these five days. \n#### 5940"}

{"question": "Tom plans to buy a new laptop and a phone. The price of the laptop is $750, which is $150 more than twice the price of the phone. After purchasing these two items, he also needs to pay a 10% sales tax. How much will he spend in total?", "answer": "1. The problem states that Tom plans to buy a new laptop and a phone. The price of the laptop is $750, which is $150 more than twice the price of the phone. We need to find out how much Tom will spend in total after purchasing these two items, including the sales tax.\n2. Let's find out the price of the phone. By problem, the price of the laptop is $750, which is $150 more than twice the price of the phone. To find the price of the phone, we subtract $150 from the price of the laptop: $750 - $150 = $600.\n3. By step 2, we know that twice the price of the phone is $600. To find the price of the phone, we divide $600 by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.\n4. The total price before tax for both items is the price of the laptop plus the price of the phone: $750 (laptop) + $300 (phone) = $1050.\n5. The sales tax is 10% of the total price before tax. To find the sales tax, we multiply 10% (0.10) by $1050: 0.10 * $1050 = $105.\n6. To find out how much Tom will spend in total, we add the total price before tax to the sales tax: $1050 (items) + $105 (tax) = $1155.\n7. [Final solution] Thus, Tom will spend $1155 in total.\n#### 1155"}

{"question": "John is driving his car on a highway. His car's speed is 70 miles per hour. He needs to travel a distance of 210 miles to reach his destination. However, every 30 miles, he takes a break of 10 minutes. How many minutes will it take John to reach his destination?", "answer": "1. The problem states that John is driving his car on a highway. His car's speed is 70 miles per hour. He needs to travel a distance of 210 miles to reach his destination. However, every 30 miles, he takes a break of 10 minutes. We need to find out how many minutes it will take John to reach his destination.\n2. To calculate the time John takes to travel 210 miles without breaks, we divide the distance by the speed: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.\n3. Since we need the answer in minutes, we convert the time from hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.\n4. Next, we calculate how many breaks John takes on his journey. We divide the total distance by the distance covered in each break: 210 miles / 30 miles/break = 7 breaks.\n5. Then, we calculate the total time John spends on breaks by multiplying the number of breaks by the time spent in each break: 7 breaks * 10 minutes/break = 70 minutes.\n6. Finally, we add the time John spends on breaks to the time he spends driving to find the total time: 180 minutes + 70 minutes = 250 minutes.\n7. [Final solution] Thus, it will take John 250 minutes to reach his destination. \n#### 250"}

To find out how far she traveled, we multiply her speed by the time: 50 miles per hour * 2 hours = <<50*2=100>>100 miles.\n4. By problem, Linda traveled at 45 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find out how far she traveled, we multiply her speed by the time: 45 miles per hour * 3 hours = <<45*3=135>>135 miles.\n5. To find out the total distance she drove, we add up the distances from steps 2, 3, and 4: 180 miles + 100 miles + 135 miles = <<180+100+135=415>>415 miles.\n6. By problem, Linda's final destination is 385 miles away. To find out how much she overshot, we subtract the distance she traveled from her final destination: 415 miles - 385 miles = <<415-385=30>>30 miles.\n7. Assuming she drives back at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, we can calculate the extra time spent driving back. To do this, we divide the distance she overshot by her speed: 30 miles / 60 miles per hour = <<30/60=0.5>>0.5 hours.\n8. To find out the total time she spent on the trip, we add up the times from each step. She spent 3 hours on the first drive, 1 hour for lunch, 2 hours on the second drive, 0.5 hours for a break, 3 hours on the third drive, 2 hours for rest, and 0.5 hours for the drive back: 3 hours + 1 hour + 2 hours + 0.5 hours + 3 hours + 2 hours + 0.5 hours = <<3+1+2+0.5+3+2+0.5=12>>12 hours.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, Linda spent a total of 12 hours on the trip. \n#### 12"}

The problem states that a group of 15 friends went to a music festival and decided to split the cost of food and drinks equally. However, 5 of them forgot their wallets, so the remaining friends had to cover their share, which increased each person's contribution by $20. We need to find out the total cost for food and drinks.\n2. Let N be the original price that each friend was going to pay.\n3. By problem, there are 15 friends in total, so the total cost for food and drinks should be 15N.\n4. By problem, 5 friends forgot their wallets, so the remaining friends had to cover their share. This means that each person's contribution increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per person is N + $20.\n5. By steps 3 and 4, we can set up the equation: 15N = 10(N + $20). This equation represents the total cost for food and drinks (15N) being divided equally among the remaining 10 friends (N + $20).\n6. By step 5, we need to solve the equation: 15N = 10N + $200.\n7.

To find out the cost of one party bag, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.\n   - Each toy costs $0.50, so 2 toys will cost 2 * $0.50 = $1.\n   - Each pack of stickers costs $0.75.\n   - Each candy costs $0.25, so 3 candies will cost 3 * $0.25 = $0.75.\n   Therefore, the cost of one party bag is $1 + $0.75 + $0.75 = $2.50.\n3. There are 12 children invited to the party. To find out how much Katie will spend on the party bags, we need to multiply the cost of one party bag by the number of children invited: $2.50 * 12 = $30.\n4. [Final solution] Thus, Katie will spend $30 on the party bags. \n#### 30"}

How many more miles per gallon did the truck achieve than the estimated fuel efficiency?", "answer": "1. The problem states that a truck has a fuel efficiency of 20 miles per gallon. The truck's tank can hold 15 gallons of fuel. The truck driver filled up the tank and drove a total of 250 miles. We need to find out how many more miles per gallon the truck achieved than the estimated fuel efficiency.\n2. To find the truck's fuel efficiency, we divide the total number of miles driven by the number of gallons of fuel used. By problem, the truck driver filled up the tank and drove a total of 250 miles. And the truck's tank can hold 15 gallons of fuel. Therefore, the truck achieved a rate of 250 miles / 15 gallons = <<250/15=16.67>>16.67 miles per gallon.\n3. To find the difference in fuel efficiency, we subtract the estimated fuel efficiency from the actual fuel efficiency. By problem, the estimated fuel efficiency is 20 miles per gallon. Therefore, the difference is 20 - 16.67 = <<20-16.67=3.33>>3.33 miles per gallon.\n4.

The problem states that in a marathon, Bob ran twice as many miles as Alice. Alice ran 10 miles less than 3 times the number of miles that Charlie ran. Charlie ran 5 miles less than half the number of miles that Bob ran. We need to find out how many more miles Bob ran than Charlie.\n2. Let's denote the number of miles Charlie ran as x. \n3. By problem, Alice ran 10 miles less than 3 times the number of miles that Charlie ran. Therefore, Alice ran 3x - 10 miles.\n4. By problem, Bob ran twice as many miles as Alice. Therefore, Bob ran 2*(3x - 10) = 6x - 20 miles.\n5. By problem, Charlie ran 5 miles less than half the number of miles that Bob ran. Therefore, half the number of miles Bob ran is (6x - 20)/2 = 3x - 10 miles.\n6. To find out how many miles Charlie ran, we add 5 miles to the half the number of miles Bob ran: 3x - 10 + 5 = 3x - 5 miles.\n7.

If you buy more than 10 books, you get an additional 1/2 off the discounted price of the number of books over 10. We need to find out how much the books cost in total if you bought 15 books that were normally priced at $40.\n2. By problem, with a 30% off sale, you save $12 per book. We can calculate this by multiplying the original price ($40) by 30%: $40 * 30% = $40 * 0.3 = $12.\n3. By step 2, we can find the price of the books after the 30% discount. We subtract the discount amount from the original price: $40 - $12 = $28. So, the books cost $28 each.\n4. By problem, you bought 15 books. To find out how many books are eligible for the additional 1/2 off discount, we subtract the required 10 books from the total number of books: 15 - 10 = 5.\n5. By step 3, we know that each book costs $28. To find out how much you saved on the additional 5 books, we multiply the discounted price by 1/2: $28 * (1/2) = $28 * 0.5 = $14. So, you save an extra $14 on these 5 books.\n6. By step 3 and step 4, we can find the total cost of the first ten books. Each book costs $28, so 10 books would cost $28 * 10 = $280.\n7.

Car B costs twice as much as Car A. Car C cost three times as much as Car A plus $50,000. How much did Car A cost?", "answer": "1. The problem states that John is a car salesman who earns a base salary of $2,000 a month plus a 5% commission on every car he sells. In one month, John sells 5 cars and earns a total of $10,000. We need to find out how much Car A cost.\n2. First, let's figure out how much money John earned from commission by subtracting his base salary from his total earnings: $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000.\n3. Next, let's figure out how much all three cars cost by dividing John's commission money by his commission rate: $8,000 ÷ 0.05 = $160,000.\n4. Let's express each car's price in terms of Car A's price. According to the problem, Car B costs twice as much as Car A, so we can say B = 2A. Also, Car C costs three times as much as Car A plus $50,000, so we can say C = 3A + $50,000.\n5. Now we can set up an equation using the prices of the three cars: A + 2A + 3A + $50,000 = $160,000.\n6. Let's combine like terms to simplify the equation: 6A + $50,000 = $160,000.\n7. Now we want to isolate the variable A. We can do this by subtracting $50,000 from both sides of the equation: 6A = $160,000 - $50,000 = $110,000.\n8. Finally, we can solve for A by dividing both sides of the equation by 6: A = $110,000 ÷ 6 = $18,333.33.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, Car A cost $18,333.33. \n#### 18333.33"}

By problem, one-fourth of the books are fiction. To find out how many fiction books there are, we multiply the total number of books by 1/4: 200 books * 1/4 = <<200*1/4=50>>50 books.\n3. By problem, one-third of the books are non-fiction. To find out how many non-fiction books there are, we multiply the total number of books by 1/3: 200 books * 1/3 = <<200*1/3=66.67>>66.67 books. Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 67 books.\n4. By steps 2 and 3, we know that 50 books are fiction and 67 books are non-fiction. Therefore, the total number of books that are either fiction or non-fiction is 50 books + 67 books = <<50+67=117>>117 books.\n5.

{"question": "In a school, there are 120 students. The number of girls is 20 less than twice the number of boys. The rest are teachers. How many teachers are there in the school?", "answer": "1. The problem states that in a school, there are 120 students. The number of girls is 20 less than twice the number of boys. The rest are teachers. We need to find out how many teachers are there in the school.\n2. Let's say the number of boys is x. So, the number of girls is 2x - 20.\n3. Therefore, the total number of students is x + (2x - 20) = 120.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we have 3x - 20 = 120.\n5. Adding 20 to both sides of the equation, we have 3x = 140.\n6. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we have x = 140 / 3 = 46.67. But the number of boys must be a whole number, so x = 47.\n7. Then, the number of girls is 2 * 47 - 20 = 94 - 20 = 74.\n8. Subtracting the number of boys and girls from the total number of students, we have 120 - 47 - 74 = -1. But the number of teachers can't be negative, so there's a mistake.\n9. Let's try x = 46 for the number of boys. Then, the number of girls is 2 * 46 - 20 = 92 - 20 = 72.\n10. Subtracting the number of boys and girls from the total number of students, we have 120 - 46 - 72 = 2.\n11. [Final solution] Thus, there are 2 teachers in the school.\n#### 2"}

The problem states that in a marathon race, John runs at a speed of 8 km/h for the first 2 hours. Then he speeds up and runs at a speed of 10 km/h for the next 3 hours. Meanwhile, his friend Mike runs at a consistent speed throughout the race. We need to find out how far Mike runs in 5 hours.\n2. By problem, John runs at a speed of 8 km/h for 2 hours. To find out how far John runs in the first 2 hours, we multiply his speed by the time: 8 km/h * 2 hours = << 8 * 2 = 16 >>16 km.\n3. By problem, John speeds up and runs at a speed of 10 km/h for the next 3 hours. To find out how far John runs in the next 3 hours, we multiply his speed by the time: 10 km/h * 3 hours = << 10 * 3 = 30 >>30 km.\n4. To find out the total distance John runs in 5 hours, we need to add the distances from steps 2 and 3: 16 km + 30 km = << 16 + 30 = 46 >>46 km.\n5. By step 4, we know that John runs a total of 46 km in 5 hours.\n6. To find out John's average speed in the race, we divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken: 46 km / 5 hours = << 46 / 5 = 9.2 >>9.2 km/h.\n7. By problem and step 6, we know that Mike runs twice as fast as John's average speed. Therefore, Mike's speed is 9.2 km/h * 2 = << 9.2 * 2 = 18.4 >>18.4 km/h.\n8. To find out how far Mike runs in 5 hours, we multiply his speed by the time: 18.4 km/h * 5 hours = << 18.4 * 5 = 92 >>92 km.\n9. [Final solution] Therefore, Mike runs 92 km in 5 hours. \n#### 92."}
{"question": "In a basketball tournament, the Tigers team won 3 more than twice the number of games that the Lions team won. The Eagles team won 5 less than the Tigers team and the total number of games won by all three teams is 45. How many games did the Lions team win?", "answer": "1. The problem states that in a basketball tournament, the Tigers team won 3 more than twice the number of games that the Lions team won. The Eagles team won 5 less than the Tigers team, and the total number of games won by all three teams is 45. We need to find out how many games the Lions team won.\n2. Let l be the number of games the Lions team won, t be the number of games the Tigers team won, and e be the number of games the Eagles team won.\n3. By problem, the Tigers team won 3 more than twice the number of games that the Lions team won. Therefore, we have the equation t = 2l + 3.\n4. By problem, the Eagles team won 5 less than the Tigers team. Therefore, we have the equation e = t - 5.\n5. By problem, the total number of games won by all three teams is 45. Therefore, we have the equation l + t + e = 45.\n6. Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get l + 2l + 3 - 5 + l = 45.\n7. Combining like terms, we get 4l - 2 = 45.\n8. Adding 2 to both sides, we get 4l = 47.\n9. Dividing both sides by 4, we get l = 47 / 4 = 11.75.\n10. As the final result must be a whole number and the quotient of all divisions is an integer, the Lions team could not have won a fraction of a game. Therefore, we round up the remainder. This means the Lions team won 11 games, and the remaining 0.75 games round up to 1 more game for the Tigers team.\n11. [Final solution] Thus, the Lions team won 11 games. \n#### 11"}

By problem, Adam plans to drive for 7 days. To find out how many miles he will drive in total, we multiply the number of miles he drives in a day by the number of days he plans to drive: 300 miles a day * 7 days = 2100 miles.\n4. By problem, Adam's car needs to be refueled every 300 miles. To find out how many times he will need to refuel, we divide the total number of miles he will drive by the number of miles per refuel: 2100 miles / 300 miles per refuel = 7 refuels.\n5. By problem, Adam's car has a fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon. To find out how many gallons of gas he will need per refuel, we divide the number of miles per refuel by the fuel efficiency: 300 miles per refuel / 25 miles per gallon = 12 gallons per refuel.\n6. To find out how many gallons of gas Adam will need for his trip, we multiply the number of gallons per refuel by the number of refuels: 12 gallons per refuel * 7 refuels = 84 gallons of gas.\n7. By problem, one gallon of gas costs $2.50. To find out how much Adam will spend on gas for his trip, we multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons: 84 gallons * $2.50 per gallon = $210.\n8.

{"question": "Linda and Peter are painting houses for summer jobs. Linda can paint a house in 7 hours, while Peter can paint the same house in 5 hours. If they work together, painting the same house, how long will it take them to finish painting?", "answer": "1. The problem states that Linda can paint a house in 7 hours, while Peter can paint the same house in 5 hours. We need to find out how long it will take them to finish painting the same house if they work together.\n2. Let's first calculate how much of the house Linda can paint in one hour. Since she can paint a house in 7 hours, she paints 1/7 of the house per hour.\n3. Now let's calculate how much of the house Peter can paint in one hour. Since he can paint a house in 5 hours, he paints 1/5 of the house per hour.\n4. When Linda and Peter work together, they can paint a combined portion of the house in one hour. To find out this combined portion, we add the fractions: 1/7 + 1/5 = (5 + 7) / (7 * 5) = 12/35.\n5. Therefore, when Linda and Peter work together, they can paint 12/35 of the house per hour.\n6. To find out how long it will take them to finish painting the house, we divide the total portion of the house (1) by the combined portion they can paint in one hour (12/35): 1 / (12/35) = 35/12.\n7. Thus, it will take them 35/12 hours to finish painting the house together, which is approximately 2.92 hours.\n8. [Final solution] Therefore, it will take Linda and Peter approximately 2.92 hours to finish painting the house together. \n#### 2.92"}

To find out how many stickers Sarah gave to Lily, we multiply the total number of stickers by 1/3: 1/3 * 60 = 60/3 = <<1/3*60=20>>20 stickers.\n3. To find out how many stickers Sarah gave to Emma, we multiply the total number of stickers by 1/5: 1/5 * 60 = 60/5 = <<1/5*60=12>>12 stickers.\n4. To find out the total number of stickers Sarah gave away, we add the number of stickers given to Lily and Emma together: 20 + 12 = <<20+12=32>>32 stickers.\n5. To find out how many stickers Sarah has left, we subtract the total number of stickers given away from the total number of stickers she bought: 60 - 32 = <<60-32=28>>28 stickers.\n6.

By problem, the team scored 3 goals in the first half of the game. \n3. By problem, the team scored twice as many goals in the second half as they did in the first half. Since they scored 3 goals in the first half, they scored 3 goals * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 goals in the second half.\n4. To find out the total number of goals in the game, we need to add the number of goals in the first half and the number of goals in the second half. By steps 2 and 3, the team scored 3 goals in the first half + 6 goals in the second half = <<3+6=9>>9 goals in total.\n5. By problem, each goal is worth 1 point. To find out the total points scored in the game, we need to multiply the number of goals by the points per goal. By step 4, the team scored 9 goals * 1 point = <<9*1=9>>9 points from goals.\n6.

{"question": "A factory produces 500 toys daily. Each toy uses 5 components. Due to a machine error, 20% of the components are wasted and cannot be used for toy production. If the factory orders 12000 components, how many days can the factory continue to produce toys?", "answer": "1. The problem states that a factory produces 500 toys daily and each toy uses 5 components. Due to a machine error, 20% of the components are wasted and cannot be used for toy production. The factory has ordered 12,000 components and we need to find out how many days the factory can continue to produce toys.\n2. By problem, the number of components wasted is 20% of 12,000. To find out the number of components wasted, we multiply 12,000 by 20%: 20/100 * 12,000 = 2400 components.\n3. By problem and step 2, the number of components that can be used to produce toys is the total number of components ordered minus the number of components wasted: 12,000 - 2400 = 9600 components.\n4. By problem, each day the factory uses 500 toys and each toy uses 5 components. To find out the number of components used daily, we multiply the number of toys produced daily by the number of components used per toy: 500 * 5 = 2500 components.\n5. By steps 3 and 4, we can find out how many days the factory can continue to produce toys. We divide the number of components that can be used to produce toys by the number of components used daily: 9600 / 2500 = 3.84 days.\n6. Since the factory cannot produce toys for a fraction of a day, the factory can continue to produce toys for 3 days.\n7. [Final solution] Thus, the factory can continue to produce toys for 3 days. \n#### 3"}

She eats 5 chocolates and gives 3/5 of the remaining chocolates to her friend. She then buys 10 more chocolates and her brother eats half of them. Samantha finally has 25 chocolates left. We need to find out how many chocolates Samantha originally had.\n2. Let's first figure out how many chocolates Samantha had after her brother ate half of them. By problem, Samantha has 25 chocolates left, and her brother ate half of them, so she must have had 25 chocolates + 25 chocolates = <<25+25=50>>50 chocolates.\n3. Next, let's figure out how many chocolates Samantha had before she bought more. By problem, Samantha's brother ate half of the chocolates, so Samantha had twice as many chocolates before her brother ate them. Therefore, she must have had 50 chocolates * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 chocolates.\n4. Then, let's figure out how many chocolates Samantha had before she gave some to her friend. By problem, Samantha gave 3/5 of the remaining chocolates to her friend. Since she had 100 chocolates before buying more, she must have had 100 chocolates * 5/3 = <<100*5/3=166.67>>166.67 chocolates. However, since we are dealing with whole numbers of chocolates, we can't have a fraction, so we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Samantha must have had 166 chocolates.\n5. Finally, let's add the chocolates Samantha ate to find out how many chocolates she originally had. By problem, Samantha ate 5 chocolates. Therefore, she must have originally had 166 chocolates + 5 chocolates = <<166+5=171>>171 chocolates.\n6. [Final solution] Thus, Samantha originally had 171 chocolates. \n#### 171"}

The problem states that in a basketball tournament, Team A scored 90 points in the first match, 85 points in the second match, and 95 points in the third match. We need to find out how many points Team B has in total.\n2. By problem, Team B scored 10% less than Team A in each match. To find out how many points Team B scored in the first match, we need to subtract 10% of Team A's score from Team A's score. In the first match, Team A scored 90 points. Therefore, Team B scored 90 * 10% = 90 * 10/100 = 9 points less than Team A.\n3. By step 2, to find out how many points Team B scored in the first match, we subtract the points Team B scored less from Team A's score. So, Team B scored 90 - 9 = 81 points in the first match.\n4. By problem and step 2, we can follow the same logic to find out how many points Team B scored in the second and third matches. In the second match, Team A scored 85 points. Therefore, Team B scored 85 * 10% = 85 * 10/100 = 8.5 points less than Team A. So, Team B scored 85 - 8.5 = 76.5 points in the second match. In the third match, Team A scored 95 points. Therefore, Team B scored 95 * 10% = 95 * 10/100 = 9.5 points less than Team A. So, Team B scored 95 - 9.5 = 85.5 points in the third match.\n5. Before the penalty, Team B scored 81 + 76.5 + 85.5 = 243 points in total.\n6. By problem, we need to subtract 15 points as a penalty from the total points. So, after subtracting the penalty, Team B has 243 - 15 = 228 points in total.\n7. [Final solution] Thus, Team B has 228 points in total. \n#### 228"}

{"question": "A car travels at a speed of 60 km/h. If the car increases its speed by 20% each hour, what is the total distance the car has traveled after 3 hours?", "answer": "1. The problem states that a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h and increases its speed by 20% each hour. We need to find out the total distance the car has traveled after 3 hours.\n2. In the first hour, the car travels at a speed of 60 km/h. Therefore, the distance traveled in the first hour is 60 km.\n3. In the second hour, the car's speed increases by 20% of its original speed. The original speed is 60 km/h, so the increased speed is 60 km/h * 20% = 60 km/h * 0.2 = 12 km/h. Therefore, the new speed is 60 km/h + 12 km/h = 72 km/h. The distance traveled in the second hour is the speed multiplied by the time, so it is 72 km/h * 1 hour = 72 km.\n4. In the third hour, the car's speed increases by 20% of its speed in the second hour. The speed in the second hour is 72 km/h, so the increased speed is 72 km/h * 20% = 72 km/h * 0.2 = 14.4 km/h. Therefore, the new speed is 72 km/h + 14.4 km/h = 86.4 km/h. The distance traveled in the third hour is the speed multiplied by the time, so it is 86.4 km/h * 1 hour = 86.4 km.\n5. To find out the total distance the car has traveled after 3 hours, we need to add the distances traveled in each hour. In the first hour, the car traveled 60 km. In the second hour, the car traveled 72 km. In the third hour, the car traveled 86.4 km. Therefore, the total distance is 60 km + 72 km + 86.4 km = 218.4 km.\n6. [Final solution] Thus, the total distance the car has traveled after 3 hours is 218.4 km. \n#### 218.4"}

The shopkeeper sold 1/3 of the red apples, and the rest were eaten by worms. We need to find out how many red apples were eaten by worms.\n2. To find out the number of green apples, we multiply the total number of apples by the percentage of green apples: 60 * 0.20 = 12.\n3. By step 2, we know that there are 12 green apples. Since the total number of apples is 60, the number of red apples is 60 - 12 = 48.\n4. By problem and step 3, the shopkeeper sold 1/3 of the red apples. To find out the number of sold red apples, we divide the total number of red apples by 3: 48 / 3 = 16.\n5. By problem and steps 3 and 4, to find out the number of red apples eaten by worms, we subtract the number of sold red apples from the total number of red apples: 48 - 16 = 32.\n6.

The problem states that a bookstore is selling 2 novels for $6, and 3 magazines for $5. Sam wants to buy 15 of the cheaper item, and we need to find out how much he would spend.\n2. To determine which item is cheaper individually, we need to find out the price for a single novel. We divide the total price of novels by the number of novels: $6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 per novel.\n3. Similarly, we find out the price of an individual magazine by dividing the total price of magazines by the number of magazines: $5 / 3 = <<5/3=1.67>>1.67 per magazine.\n4. Since $1.67 is less than $3, the magazines are cheaper.\n5. To determine the amount Sam would spend, we multiply the price of an individual magazine by the number of magazines he wants to buy: $1.67 * 15 = <<1.67*15=25.05>>25.05.\n6.

{"question": "In a fruit market, the ratio of apples to oranges is 4:3 and the ratio of apples to bananas is 2:5. If there are 180 fruits in total, how many bananas are there?", "answer": "1. The problem states that in a fruit market, the ratio of apples to oranges is 4:3 and the ratio of apples to bananas is 2:5. We need to find out how many bananas there are.\n2. Let a be the number of apples, o be the number of oranges, and b be the number of bananas.\n3. From the first ratio, we can write the equation a/o = 4/3.\n4. Solving for a in terms of o, we have a = 4o/3.\n5. Substituting the expression for a into the second ratio, we get (4o/3)/b = 2/5.\n6. Cross-multiplying, we get 5 * 4o = 2 * 3b.\n7. Simplifying, we have 20o = 6b.\n8. Dividing both sides by 6, we get 20o/6 = b.\n9. Simplifying, we have b = 10o/3.\n10. Therefore, the number of bananas is given by b = 10o/3.\n11. We also know that the total number of fruits is a + o + b = 180.\n12. Substituting the expressions for a and b into this equation, we get 4o/3 + o + 10o/3 = 180.\n13. Combining like terms, we have (4o + 3o + 10o)/3 = 180.\n14. Simplifying, we have 17o/3 = 180.\n15. Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction, we have 17o = 540.\n16. Dividing both sides by 17, we have o = 540/17.\n17. Evaluating o, we get o ≈ 31.7647.\n18. Since the number of oranges should be an integer, we round o up to 32.\n19. Substituting o = 32 into the expression for b = 10o/3, we get b = 10 * 32/3 = 320/3 ≈ 106.6667.\n20. As the number of bananas should be an integer, we round b up to 107.\n21. [Final solution] Thus, there are 113 bananas in the fruit market."}

We need to find out how many vehicles were needed to take all the students back to school.\n2. By problem, there are 5 groups and each group has 6 students. To find out the total number of students, we multiply the number of groups by the number of students per group: 5 groups * 6 students/group = <<5*6=30>>30 students.\n3. By problem, 3 students fell ill and had to take a separate vehicle. To find out the number of healthy students, we subtract the number of ill students from the total number of students: 30 students - 3 students = <<30-3=27>>27 healthy students.\n4. By problem and step 3, each vehicle can take 4 students. To find out the number of vehicles needed for the healthy students, we divide the number of healthy students by the number of students per vehicle: 27 healthy students / 4 students/vehicle = <<27/4=6.75>>6.75 vehicles. Since we can't have a fraction of a vehicle, we round up to the nearest whole number: 7 vehicles.\n5. By problem and step 4, the ill students took a separate vehicle. So, the total number of vehicles needed is the number of vehicles for the healthy students plus 1 for the ill students: 7 vehicles + 1 vehicle = <<7+1=8>>8 vehicles.\n6.

The problem states that Sarah is planning a birthday party and wants to buy balloons and party hats. The price of a balloon is twice the price of a party hat. She has a budget of $50. If she spent all her money and bought 5 more party hats than balloons, we need to find out how much one balloon costs.\n2. Let H be the price of a party hat and B be the price of a balloon.\n3. By problem, we know that the price of a balloon is twice the price of a party hat. Therefore, we can write the equation B = 2H.\n4. By problem, Sarah bought 5 more party hats than balloons, so the number of party hats is B + 5.\n5. By problem, the total cost of the party hats and balloons is $50. Therefore, we can write the equation B*(B + 5) + H*(B + 5) = $50.\n6. Substituting the value of B from equation 3 into equation 5 gives (2H)*(2H + 5) + H*(2H + 5) = $50.\n7. Simplifying equation 6 gives 4H^2 + 10H + 2H^2 + 5H = $50.\n8. Combining like terms in equation 7 gives 6H^2 + 15H = $50.\n9. Moving all terms to one side of the equation gives 6H^2 + 15H - $50 = 0.\n10. To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: H = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 6, b = 15, and c = -50.\n11. Plugging in the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula gives H = (-15 ± sqrt(15^2 - 4*6*(-50))) / (2*6).\n12. Simplifying the expression inside the square root gives H = (-15 ± sqrt(225 + 1200)) / 12.\n13. Further simplifying gives H = (-15 ± sqrt(1425)) / 12.\n14. Taking the square root of 1425 gives H = (-15 ± sqrt(3*475)) / 12.\n15. Breaking down 475 into its prime factors gives H = (-15 ± sqrt(3*5^2*19)) / 12.\n16. Simplifying gives H = (-15 ± 5sqrt(3*19)) / 12.\n17. Taking out the common factor of 5 from the square root gives H = (-15 ± 5*sqrt(57)) / 12.\n18. Further simplifying gives H = (-3 ± sqrt(57)) / 2.\n19. Therefore, the possible values of H are (-3 + sqrt(57)) / 2 and (-3 - sqrt(57)) / 2.\n20. Since we are looking for the price of a party hat, we take the positive value of H, which is (-3 + sqrt(57)) / 2.\n21. Plugging in the value of H into equation 3 gives B = 2*(-3 + sqrt(57)) / 2.\n22. Simplifying gives B = -3 + sqrt(57).\n23. Therefore, one balloon costs -3 + sqrt(57).\n24. To simplify the answer, we calculate the numerical value of the expression: -3 + sqrt(57) = <<-3+sqrt(57)=3.74>>3.74.\n25. [Final solution] Thus, one balloon costs $3.74. \n#### 3.74"}
{"question": "Sophie wants to build a rectangular garden. She has 24 feet of fencing and wants to use it all. If she makes the width of the garden 6 feet, what will the length be? And how much area will the garden have?", "answer": "1. The problem states that Sophie wants to build a rectangular garden. She has 24 feet of fencing and wants to use it all. We need to find out the length of the garden and the area of the garden.\n2. By problem, the perimeter of the garden is 24 feet. In a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated as 2 times the sum of the length and the width. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2*(length + width) = 24.\n3. By problem, Sophie makes the width of the garden 6 feet. Substituting this value into the equation from step 2, we have: 2*(length + 6) = 24.\n4. To find out the length of the garden, we need to solve the equation from step 3. We can start by simplifying the equation: 2*length + 2*6 = 24, which simplifies to 2*length + 12 = 24.\n5. Next, we isolate the term with the length by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation: 2*length = 24 - 12 = 12.\n6. To find the value of length, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: length = 12 / 2 = 6 feet.\n7. By step 6, we find that the length of the garden is 6 feet.\n8. To find out the area of the garden, we multiply the length by the width: area = length * width = 6 feet * 6 feet = 36 square feet.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, the length of the garden is 6 feet and the area of the garden is 36 square feet. \n#### 36"}
{"question": "A library has 150 books in total. The number of non-fiction books is 3 times the number of fiction books. How many fiction books are there in the library?", "answer": "1. The problem states that a library has a total of 150 books. We need to find out how many fiction books are there in the library.\n2. Let's say the number of fiction books is f.\n3. By problem, the number of non-fiction books is 3 times the number of fiction books. Therefore, the number of non-fiction books is 3f.\n4. To find out the total number of books, we need to add the number of fiction books and the number of non-fiction books together. By steps 2 and 3, the total number of books is f + 3f = 4f.\n5. By problem, the total number of books is 150. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 4f = 150.\n6. To solve for f, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: f = 150/4.\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get: f = 37.5.\n8. [Final solution] Thus, there are 37.5 fiction books in the library. However, since we cannot have half of a book, the actual number of fiction books in the library would be the closest whole number to 37.5, which is 37. \n#### 37"}

The problem states that a bookstore has 5000 books. 40% of the books are novels, 30% are textbooks, and the rest are other types of books. We need to find out how many books are left in the bookstore.\n2. By problem, 40% of the books are novels. To find out the number of novels in the bookstore, we multiply the total number of books by the percentage of novels: 5000 books * 40% = 5000 * 0.4 = <<5000*0.4=2000>>2000 books.\n3. By problem, 30% of the books are textbooks. To find out the number of textbooks in the bookstore, we multiply the total number of books by the percentage of textbooks: 5000 books * 30% = 5000 * 0.3 = <<5000*0.3=1500>>1500 books.\n4. By problem, the rest of the books are other types of books. Therefore, the number of other types of books is the total number of books minus the number of novels minus the number of textbooks: 5000 books - 2000 books - 1500 books = <<5000-2000-1500=1500>>1500 books.\n5. By problem and step 2, 20% of the novels are sold. To find out the number of novels sold, we multiply the number of novels by the percentage of novels sold: 2000 books * 20% = 2000 * 0.2 = <<2000*0.2=400>>400 books.\n6. By problem and step 3, 10% of the textbooks are sold. To find out the number of textbooks sold, we multiply the number of textbooks by the percentage of textbooks sold: 1500 books * 10% = 1500 * 0.1 = <<1500*0.1=150>>150 books.\n7. To find out the total number of books sold, we add the number of novels sold and the number of textbooks sold: 400 books + 150 books = <<400+150=550>>550 books.\n8. By step 7, the number of books left in the bookstore is the total number of books minus the total number of books sold: 5000 books - 550 books = <<5000-550=4450>>4450 books.\n9. [Final solution] Thus, there are 4450 books left in the bookstore. \n#### 4450"}

The total distance from City A to City C is 220 miles. How long does the train take to travel from City A to City C, including the stop?", "answer": "1. The problem states that a train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It stops at City B for 15 minutes before continuing to City C at a speed of 80 miles per hour. The total distance from City A to City C is 220 miles. We need to find out how long the train takes to travel from City A to City C, including the stop.\n2. Let's denote the distance from City A to City B as D1 and the distance from City B to City C as D2. Therefore, we have the equation D1 + D2 = 220 miles.\n3. We know that time = distance / speed. So, the time it takes to travel from City A to City B is D1 / 60 (since the speed is 60 miles per hour) and the time it takes to travel from City B to City C is D2 / 80 (since the speed is 80 miles per hour).\n4. The total time including the stop is the time to travel from City A to City B + the time spent at the stop + the time to travel from City B to City C. Therefore, the total time is D1 / 60 + 15 minutes (which is equal to 15 / 60 hours, since there are 60 minutes in an hour) + D2 / 80.\n5. Assuming D1 is 120 miles, we can calculate D2 as follows: D2 = 220 - 120 = 100 miles.\n6. Substituting the values of D1 and D2 into the equation from step 4, we get the total time as 120 / 60 + 15 / 60 + 100 / 80 = 2 + 0.25 + 1.25 = 3.5 hours.\n7. [Final solution] Thus, the train takes 3.5 hours to travel from City A to City C, including the stop. \n#### 3.5"}

The problem states that a school library has 120 books. 25% of the books are fiction, 35% are non-fiction, and the rest are reference books. We need to find out the total cost of all the books.\n2. To find the number of fiction books, we multiply the total number of books by the percentage of fiction books: 120 books * 25% = 120 * 0.25 = <<120*0.25=30>>30 fiction books.\n3. To find the number of non-fiction books, we multiply the total number of books by the percentage of non-fiction books: 120 books * 35% = 120 * 0.35 = <<120*0.35=42>>42 non-fiction books.\n4. To find the number of reference books, we subtract the number of fiction books and non-fiction books from the total number of books: 120 books - 30 fiction books - 42 non-fiction books = 120 - 30 - 42 = <<120-30-42=48>>48 reference books.\n5. To calculate the total cost of the fiction books, we multiply the number of fiction books by the cost per fiction book: 30 fiction books * $1.50 per fiction book = 30 * 1.5 = <<30*1.5=45>>$45.\n6.
