Buying five lollipops amounts to $0.4 x 5 = $2. Consequently, the four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. Therefore, the price of each candy is $1.20/4 = $0.30. Acquiring ten lollipops would cost $0.4 x 10 = $4, and buying ten candies would cost $0.30 x 10 = $3. Therefore, purchasing 10 lollipops and 10 candies would total $4 + $3 = $7.\n#### 7",

To begin, calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is away: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes. Next, determine the net number of holes Nate fills in daily: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day. After that, divide the total number of holes by the daily reduction in the holes filled to find the number of days Nate spends filling holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days.

Begin by setting up the equation 3r + 5w = 42 to represent the daily egg production, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens. Given that w = r + 2, substitute r + 2 for w in the equation to get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. Simplify by expanding the parentheses to get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. Combine like terms to obtain 8r + 10 = 42, then subtract 10 from both sides to get 8r = 32. Finally, divide by 8 to find that r = 4.\n#### 4",

The first place charges a fixed rate of $200, regardless of the number of guests, while the second venue charges $25 for each attendee. The first venue doesn't cover food, which Mark estimates will be $5 per guest. However, the second venue includes food in the price. How many guests are needed for the costs of the two venues to be the same?  The total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5*X, where X represents the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be represented as 25*X. To find the number of guests needed for the costs to be equal, we set 200 + 5*X equal to 25*X. Solving this equation, we get 200 = 20*X after subtracting 5*X from both sides. Hence, X = 200/20 = 10, meaning that when there are 10 guests, the costs of the two venues will be equal.\n#### 10",

With each box weighing 8 ounces, the total weight is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

Presently, the larger pool has four times the amount of water compared to the smaller pool. How much water does the small pool currently hold?  The amount of water lost in 4 minutes is 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons. Let b represent the water content of the big pool and s represent the water content of the small pool. Given that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16), substituting the first equation into the second gives 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16). By simplifying, 4s + 16 = 2s + 32. After subtracting 2s from both sides, 2s + 16 = 32. Further subtraction of 16 from both sides yields 2s = 16. Dividing both sides by 2 gives s = <<8=8>>8.\n#### 8",

How many fireworks will Hannah witness in total?  Firstly, calculate the total number of fireworks the city will launch: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks. Then, determine the number of fireworks Hannah can see by multiplying this by the fraction she can view: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks. Next, establish the quantity of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks. Finally, add the city's fireworks and Hannah's personal fireworks to get the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks.\n#### 135",

Therefore, the fifth worker's production rate was 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.\n#### 18",

After spending 3 hours baking with the oven on, which increases the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes. For every 10 minutes the window is open, the house cools down by 2 degrees. What is the final temperature of the house?  Initially, the temperature increased by 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees due to baking. Adding this to the initial temperature of 40 degrees gives 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees. The time the window is open is divided by 10 minutes to determine the number of 2-degree temperature decreases, resulting in 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3 decreases. Multiplying the number of decreases by the temperature decrease per interval gives 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees. Finally, subtracting this amount from the temperature after baking yields the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees.\n#### 49",

If each small coupon has a mailing cost of 5 cents and each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, what is the total postage expense?  Start by calculating the total cost of the small coupons: 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $<<700*0.05=35>>35. Then determine the number of big coupons Anthony will send: 700 small * 2 big/small = <<700*2=1400>>1400 big coupons. Proceed by multiplying the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon to get the total cost of the big coupons: $0.15/coupon * 1400 coupons = $<<0.15*1400=210>>210. Finally, sum up the costs of each coupon size to get the total cost: $210 + $35 = $<<210+35=245>>245.\n#### 245",

Enjoying a 10% discount on all items, what is the total amount Daniel needs to pay for his desired items?  The cost of five notebooks is $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50. For two pens, the price is 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.50>>0.50. Combining the costs of all items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.

If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he earn?  Artie will adjust the price of marigolds up from $2.74 to $3 because the digit following the 2 is 5 or greater. He will also adjust the price of petunias up from $1.87 to $2 since the digit following the 1 is 5 or greater. However, he will round the price of begonias down from $2.12 to $2 since the digit following the 2 is less than 5.

If the regular teacher shows up, there is a 40% chance she will extend the deadline. Even if the class doesn't get an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of persuading the teacher that his dog destroyed his work and getting a personal extension. What is the probability that Marcus will need to submit his homework tomorrow?  The probability of the regular teacher showing up is 100% - 50% = 50%. The chance of the teacher not granting an extension to the class is 100% - 40% = 60%. The probability of Marcus not receiving a personal extension is 100% - 20% = 80%. Multiplying the probability of the teacher coming in and not granting an extension to the class gives .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3.

If the beanstalk initially stands at 4 feet tall, how many days will it take for it to surpass the height of Mark's window?  To determine the beanstalk's height after one day, simply multiply the initial height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet. By doubling this height for two days, the beanstalk reaches 16 feet: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet. After tripling this height on the third day, it grows to 32 feet: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. Consequently, it took three days for the beanstalk to exceed the height of the window.\n#### 3",

The research extended to 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months in total, with 45 months in the more expensive research phase after the initial 5 months. Each month's cost during the initial phase was $100,000/5 = $<<100000/5=20000>>20,000. Therefore, the more expensive research phase cost $20,000 * 1.5 = $<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000 per month.

As there will be 30 kids, and Greg wants each child to have 4 jello cups, he will need 30 * 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 jello cups. Since 1 box makes 10 jello cups, he will require 120/10 = <<120/10=12>>12 boxes of jello. With each box costing $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes will be 1.25 * 12 = $<<1.25*12=15.00>>15.00.\n#### 15",

To determine the total length, start by calculating the combined length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches. Then, calculate the total length of the croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = <<120*6=720>>720 inches. Add the lengths of rolls and croissants to get the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches. Divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to convert it to feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet. Finally, calculate the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet.

If there are 10 multiple-choice questions, 20 true/false questions, and 5 long-answer questions, how many points does Amy score in total?  To calculate the number of multiple-choice questions Amy answered correctly, multiply 80% by 10 questions: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions. Then, determine the number of true/false questions she answered correctly by multiplying 90% by 20 questions: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions. Adding these two numbers gives the total number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions, which corresponds to the total points she scored since each question is worth 1 point. Next, find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly by multiplying 5 questions by 60%: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions. Multiply this by the points per question to get the points earned from long-answer questions: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points.

Next, determine the total number of individuals from 4-member families: 3 families * 4 individuals/family = <<3*4=12>>12 individuals. Combine these two totals to find the overall number of guests invited by Martha: 12 individuals + 12 individuals = <<12+12=24>>24 individuals. Then, ascertain the number of guests who couldn't attend due to sickness: 8 individuals / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 individuals. Finally, subtract the absentees from the total to determine the number of attendees: 24 individuals - 2 individuals - 8 individuals = <<24-2-8=14>>14 individuals.\n#### 14",

Therefore, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits.\n#### 168",

Half of the Llesis family's driving speed amounts to 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour. Consequently, their hiking speed was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking distance equated to 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles. Since they spent 4.5 hours driving (6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5), their total driving distance was 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.

In a specific month, her earnings from selling red hats were $400, which is half of what she made from selling green hats. If in the subsequent month she sold hats equivalent to 3/4 of the total sales in the first month, what was the total revenue from two months of sales?  Given that her earnings from selling green hats were twice that of red hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$800 from green hats. Therefore, her total earnings in the first month amount to $800+$400=$1200. In the second month, she earned 3/4*1200=$900.

The oven is inaccurate by 18 degrees since 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18. This discrepancy represents a 4% deviation since 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%.

Initially, determine the ore mined by a single dwarf with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day. Then, calculate the ore mined by a dwarf with a steel pickaxe, which is 150% more than with an iron pickaxe: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day. Next, compute the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day.

Deducting the 10 minutes allocated for intermission, we have 120 - 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for the actual performances. Since each group requires 10 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit), out of the 110 minutes for performances, each group will use 10 minutes, allowing 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups to perform.\n#### 11",

The pass rate for the 400 fifth graders was double that of the fourth graders. What is the school's overall pass rate?  Start by determining the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4. Then, double this to get the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8. Next, multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to get the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders. Total the number of passing students from each grade: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students. Sum up the total number of students in each grade: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students. Finally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of students who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%.\n#### 70",

Since 1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen, he requires 1 * 6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter. With the promotion offering one pound at half price, each 2 pounds of butter will cost 4 * 1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6.00>>6.00.

Job B offers a flat salary of $42,000 yearly, in a state that imposes $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick earn at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job?  To begin, calculate the total annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000. Then, determine the tax amount Nick owes for Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: 0.2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000. Deduct Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross income at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000. After that, subtract Nick's property taxes from his total income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000. Calculate Nick's income tax at Job B by multiplying his post-property tax earnings by 10%: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600. Finally, determine Nick's net income at Job B by subtracting the income tax from his earnings after property tax: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400. The difference between the higher-paying job (B) and the lower-paying job (A) is: $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400.\n#### 8400",

Upon reaching the checkout, the cashier informed her that there was a 20% discount on her entire purchase. What was the final amount of her order?  Since she wanted 5 utensils priced at $5.00 each, they totaled 5 * 5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00. The utensils cost $25, the pots and pans were $120, and the mixing bowls were $20, making the total 25 + 120 + 20 = $<<25+120+20=165>>165. With a 20% discount, her total cost of $165 was reduced by 165 * 0.20 = $<<165*.20=33.00>>33.00. Therefore, after the discount, her final total was $165 - $33 = $<<165-33=132.00>>132.00.\n#### 132",

Sylvie earns $600 per month, totaling $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year. The increase in Sylvie's salary after 5 years will be 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year. Over three years, her salary will increase by 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160. Therefore, after three more years, Sylvie will be earning $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360 annually.\n#### 9360",

Blake completes 15 round trips, while Kelly initially runs one round trip and then switches to running from the 40-yard line back and forth, completing this 34 times. What is the difference in the total distance covered by the winner and the loser?  Blake covers 200 yards in each round trip as 100 x 2 = 200. Therefore, his total distance covered is 3000 yards as 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000. Initially, Kelly runs 200 yards as 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200. For each round trip to the 40-yard line, she covers 80 yards as 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80. Consequently, she covers 2720 yards from these round trips as 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720. In total, she covers 2920 yards as 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920. Blake emerges as the winner because 3000 > 2920. The winner covers 80 yards more than the loser as 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80.\n#### 80",

Knowing that each car requires 4 wheels and each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, how many wheels will remain from a box containing 650 wheels after assembling all the toys?  The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels per car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels. The total number of wheels required for all the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels per motorcycle = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels. When the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles is added together, it sums up to 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels.

Start by calculating the additional widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour. Then, multiply this difference by the number of hours in a day to get the daily variance: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day. Next, multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to determine the monthly variance: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month. Finally, multiply this figure by the selling price per widget to obtain the total revenue difference: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800.\n#### 64800",

If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, how many windows does Hannah smash in total?  Begin by calculating the number of student cars Hannah smashed: 64 cars * 1/4 = <<64*1/4=16>>16 cars. Then, determine the number of teacher cars Hannah smashed: 32 cars * 3/4 = <<32*3/4=24>>24 cars. Next, find the total number of windows smashed in the students' cars: 16 cars * 4 windows/car = <<16*4=64>>64 windows. Afterward, calculate the total number of windows smashed in the teachers' cars: 24 cars * 2 windows/car = <<24*2=48>>48 windows. Finally, by adding the number of students' and teachers' windows smashed together, we find the total number of windows smashed: 64 windows + 48 windows = <<64+48=112>>112 windows.\n#### 112",

If each candle is sold for $2.00, how much is his total profit if he produces and sells 20 candles?  As he intends to make 20 candles and each pound of beeswax produces 10 candles, Charlie needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax. With each pound priced at $10.00, the total supply cost for 2 pounds is 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00. Selling each candle at $2.00 and producing 20 candles will yield 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00. By deducting the $20.00 supply cost from the $40.00 revenue, his net profit will be 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00.\n#### 20",

Following the company's guidance, the pool needs 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water. The total cost to fill the pool amounts to $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.\n#### 826",

With each nickel valued at 5 cents, 40 nickels add up to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents. Similarly, as a dime is worth 10 cents, 20 dimes sum up to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.

If she intends to purchase a certain number of goats so that the goats make up 30% of her entire collection, how many goats should she buy?  Let x represent the quantity of stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is the sum of the puppies, koalas, zebras, and frogs, which is 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals. To achieve 30% goats in the collection, the equation becomes x / (14 + x) = .3. Solving for x gives x = 0.42 + .3x. By subtracting 0.3x from both sides, we get 0.7x = 0.42.

For each additional item, there is an extra charge of $15.00. Angela needs to install 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. How much will she be charged in total?  Angela requires 6 mirrors, exceeding the 4 included, resulting in 6-4 = <<6-4=2>>2 extra mirrors. Each additional item costs $15.00, thus 2*15 = $30.00 for the extra mirrors. Since she has 2 chandeliers instead of the included 1, she has 2-1 = 1 extra chandelier, costing 1*15 = $<<1*15=15.00>>15.00. With 20 pictures instead of 10, there are 20-10 = <<20-10=10>>10 extra pictures, totaling 10*15 = $<<10*15=150.00>>150.00. Therefore, the service's base cost of $129.00, plus the additional $30.00 for mirrors, $15.00 for the chandelier, and $150.00 for the pictures, amounts to 129+30+15+150 = $<<129+30+15+150=324.00>>324.00.\n#### 324",

Helen was charged $80 for each of the 3 nights at the hotel, totaling 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240.\nThe cost of a single bus trip was 10% of $80, which is 80 * 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=8>>8.\nWith 7 bus trips, Helen's total bus expenses amounted to 7 * 8 = $<<7*8=56>>56.\nTherefore, Helen's total expenditure for the hotel and bus transportation summed up to 240 + 56 = $<<240+56=296>>296.\n#### 296",

Since the total treats are b + c = 10, substitute the expression for b into the equation: 3c - 2 + c = 10. Simplify the equation by combining like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10.

The jar has a square base measuring 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches of space, and the packing efficiency is around 80%. Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans in the jar are red. The actual number of red jelly beans in the jar is 900. How inaccurate was Tim's guess?  The total volume of the jar is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches. This means it can contain 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans. Considering an 80% packing efficiency, the jar can hold 3600*0.8=<<3600*0.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans. Therefore, Tim's estimate is that 2880*0.3=<<2880*0.3=864>>864 of the jelly beans are red.

Let s represent the number of strawberry cubes and b represent the number of blueberry cubes. Given that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116, we can substitute the first equation into the second to get s + 5s - 4 = 116. Simplifying, we find 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides yields 6s = 120.

With an annual yield of 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each, and annual maintenance costs of $3, how many years will it take for him to start making a profit from the lemon tree?  Carlos earns $10.5 per year from selling lemons, as 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5. After deducting the $3 maintenance cost, he makes $7.5 annually from the lemon tree, since 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5. It will require 12 years to cover the tree's cost, as 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12. He will begin earning profits in the 13th year, as 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13.\n#### 13",

Mr. Julius planted 2 times the number of White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

If Tyson follows his coach's advice for a month, what total distance will he have covered in June?  The coach's suggestion implies Tyson should run an additional 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 meters each day. Consequently, Tyson's daily training distance increases to 5000 meters + 1000 meters = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 meters. Therefore, in June, covering this new distance for 30 days amounts to 6000 meters/day * 30 days/month = <<6000*30=180000>>180000 meters.\n#### 180000",

Let B represent the number of tennis balls Rory collected in the third set. He gathered 2B balls in the second set and 2B + 4 balls in the first set.

As 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June, this affected 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees. This meant that in June, the number of employees with valid contracts was 40 - 10 = 30.

Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches, it translates to (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches in total. If we denote Bobby's shoe length in inches as x, then Topher's shoe length is described by the equation 9x + 10 = 100. By subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we simplify to 9x = 90.
